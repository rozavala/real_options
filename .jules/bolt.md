## 2025-02-24 - Shared aiohttp Session for Sentinels
**Learning:** Instantiating `aiohttp.ClientSession` inside frequently called methods (even if async) prevents connection pooling and adds significant TCP handshake overhead. Sentinels running in a loop were creating new sessions for every RSS fetch or API call.
**Action:** Refactored `Sentinel` base class to lazily initialize and share a single `ClientSession`. Updated `LogisticsSentinel`, `NewsSentinel`, `PredictionMarketSentinel`, `XSentimentSentinel`, and `WeatherSentinel` to reuse this session. Added explicit cleanup in `orchestrator.py`.
