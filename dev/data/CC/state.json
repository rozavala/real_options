        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-26] Ivory Coast plans to move the start of its cocoa mid-crop to March 1, 2026, facilitating a farmgate price reduction to 800-1,000 CFA francs/kg to align with global markets. (Reuters) | [2026-02-24] The Ivorian government forecasts its 2025/26 mid-crop production at 350,000 metric tons, signaling partial normalization in output. (CocoaIntel) | [2026-02-24] Experts estimate Ivory Coast will have 200,000 metric tons of unsold cocoa by end-March unless prices are cut. (Thomson Reuters) | [2026-02-25] Southern Ghana's major rainy season is projected to begin normally to slightly early, starting the third week of February 2026, which is favorable for mid-crop development. (GhanaWeb TV) | [2026-02-26] Ghana's licensed cocoa buyers owe banks up to $750 million (7-8 billion cedis), creating a severe liquidity crisis in the supply chain. (CNBC Africa)\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: Three weaknesses are identified. First, mild confirmation bias: the original analysis weighted bearish signals more heavily without sufficiently interrogating bullish counterarguments \u2014 specifically, the possibility that price reductions could clear the 200,000 MT overhang faster than modeled, or that the $750M liquidity crisis could constrain procurement and paradoxically tighten near-term physical availability. Second, the 0.92 confidence figure was numerically precise but epistemically unjustified \u2014 five data points from a two-day window cannot support that level of certainty; this reflects recency bias, treating a short snapshot as structurally definitive. Third, the claim that Ivory Coast's early mid-crop declaration was 'artificial' is an editorial inference not directly supported by cited sources; Reuters reports a policy decision, not an artificiality determination. REVISED ANALYSIS: The evidence supports a bearish directional lean but with meaningful uncertainty bands. On the bearish side: (1) a confirmed 200,000 MT unsold overhang (Thomson Reuters) creates clear downward price pressure; (2) Ivory Coast's policy-driven farmgate price cut to 800-1,000 CFA francs/kg (Reuters) confirms authorities are responding to demand-side weakness, not supply shortage; (3) Ghana's $750M buyer liquidity crisis (CNBC Africa) risks disrupting orderly procurement. On the cautionary side: (4) the liquidity crisis could slow physical bean movement, potentially masking supply on paper while tightening tradeable spot availability \u2014 a dynamic that could briefly support nearby prices even in a structurally bearish environment; (5) the 350,000 MT mid-crop forecast (CocoaIntel) represents partial normalization, not a surplus shock, and is roughly in line with historical mid-crop averages; (6) favorable early rains in Ghana (GhanaWeb TV) improve but do not guarantee mid-crop outturn. Net assessment: supply normalization plus demand-side price pressure plus financing stress is net bearish for the medium term (3-6 months), but near-term physical tightness from the liquidity-driven procurement slowdown introduces non-trivial upside risk to spot prices. Confidence is downgraded from the prior 0.92 to MODERATE given the limited evidence window and the competing dynamics between financial disruption and physical supply.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: 1. [2026-02-26] EUR/USD fell to 1.1807 (-0.03% session) but is up 13.55% over 12 months, and down 1.94% monthly \u2014 signaling near-term USD mild recovery vs EUR (Trading Economics). 2. [2026-02-25] USD/XOF rose to 556.757 (+0.36% daily), meaning the USD strengthened slightly vs the CFA franc on the day (Investing.com). 3. [2026-02-26] Ivorian President Ouattara approved an overhaul of cocoa industry rules including a harvest schedule change, responding to a two-thirds drop in world prices since July 2025 (Africa Intelligence). 4. [2026-02-25] Ghana's CMC revealed it locked in 90% of this season's volumes at historically high prices before the market correction, providing a revenue buffer despite farmgate cuts (News Ghana). 5. [2026-02-16] Ivory Coast's CCC maintained farmgate price at 2,800 CFA/kg until March 31, 2026, while a sharp reduction is expected for the mid-crop starting March 1, 2026 (MyJoyOnline / Raw Research).\n[ANALYSIS]: SELF-CRITIQUE: 1. LOGICAL FALLACIES IDENTIFIED: The original analysis contains a recency bias in its self-critique section \u2014 it retroactively re-weights policy signals as potentially bullish purely because prior BEARISH calls were wrong, not because the current evidence structurally supports bullishness. This is a form of outcome-driven reasoning (inferring cause from a pattern of forecast errors) rather than evidence-driven reasoning. Additionally, the original analysis introduced upside optionality language ('non-trivial upside') without providing any direct evidence of demand recovery, grind data, or positioning shifts to justify it \u2014 this borders on false balance. 2. SOURCE QUALITY: Sources are cited with dates and named outlets (Trading Economics, Investing.com, Africa Intelligence, News Ghana, MyJoyOnline), which is a strength. However, the XOF/USD +0.36% daily tick is treated as meaningful for producer economics when the magnitude is trivially small relative to the ~70% price collapse referenced \u2014 this is a false precision issue. 3. SENTIMENT JUSTIFICATION: The BEARISH tag is directionally correct given the evidence: a ~70% price collapse since July 2025, imminent farmgate price cuts, and no direct evidence of demand recovery or grind improvement. The self-critique section introduced speculative bullish optionality that was not grounded in the cited evidence and created an internal contradiction with the BEARISH tag at 0.65 confidence. REVISED ANALYSIS: The dominant signal across all five data points is bearish price pressure. The EUR/USD 12-month trend (USD weaker) is marginally supportive for EUR-based buyers at the demand margin, but the 1.94% monthly reversal and absence of grind data make this channel weak. The USD/XOF daily move is noise-level and immaterial against a multi-month commodity price collapse of ~70%. Ouattara's regulatory overhaul and the Ivory Coast farmgate price cut are supply-side administrative responses to a severe bear market \u2014 they indicate adaptation to lower prices, not price recovery catalysts. Ghana's CMC hedging success is a one-season anomaly that insulates government revenue but does not signal any forward price support. The absence of demand-side evidence (grind recovery, restocking, speculative long positioning) means the bearish case is not offset by any credible bullish counterweight in this data set. The prior pattern of forecast errors (predicting BEARISH while actuals were BULLISH) is noted, but correcting for that pattern requires positive evidence of reversal, not merely acknowledging the pattern. Confidence is held at MODERATE rather than HIGH because the policy overhaul introduces genuine uncertainty about supply-side response timing, and the prior forecast error pattern cannot be entirely dismissed as a systematic blind spot.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: 1) [2026-02-26] Ivory Coast resumes cocoa sales for the 2025/26 season after the CCC reduced the 'country premium' to end a standoff with international buyers. (source: GhanaWeb / Bloomberg) 2) [2026-02-25] Brazil temporarily suspended cocoa imports from Ivory Coast due to phytosanitary risks associated with the 'high influx of beans from neighboring countries'. (source: CNBC Africa) 3) [2026-02-25] Ivory Coast is reportedly considering a 35% cut to the farmgate price for the mid-crop harvest starting in April to align with global market declines. (source: TradingView / Barchart) 4) [2026-02-26] Ghanaian licensed cocoa buyers owe banks between $650 million and $750 million, creating significant liquidity risks in the supply chain. (source: CNBC Africa / Reuters) 5) [2026-02-12] Ghana's Finance Minister announced a mandatory 50% local processing requirement for cocoa beans starting from the 2026/27 season. (source: Modern Ghana)\n[ANALYSIS]: SELF-CRITIQUE BEFORE REVISION: Several weaknesses are identified in the prior analysis. (A) CONFIRMATION BIAS: The prior analysis consistently interpreted ambiguous or mixed signals as bullish. The CCC premium cut could alternatively indicate that Ivory Coast is successfully unblocking sales flow, which is bearish \u2014 this interpretation was dismissed without sufficient engagement. The 35% farmgate price cut was explicitly neutralized as a bearish signal using a self-referential prior lesson, which risks becoming a reflexive bias rather than evidence-based reasoning. (B) RECENCY BIAS / FALLACY OF ACCUMULATION: Stacking multiple disruptions (Brazil ban, processing mandate, liquidity gap, farmgate cut) and treating their co-occurrence as multiplicatively bearish overstates compounding effects without evidence that these operate simultaneously or at sufficient scale to move global prices materially. (C) SOURCE QUALITY: Sources include GhanaWeb, TradingView/Barchart, and CNBC Africa \u2014 these are secondary aggregators rather than primary institutional sources (e.g., ICCO, CCC official releases, Bloomberg terminal data). The Brazil import suspension via CNBC Africa is unverified against Brazilian MAPA or official phytosanitary authority statements. (D) ABSENCE OF BEARISH COUNTERWEIGHTS: No demand-side data was incorporated. If global cocoa demand is declining \u2014 plausibly, given record-high prices eroding chocolate consumption \u2014 the supply disruptions may be partially or fully offset. The 200,000 MT backlog mentioned in prior context implies supply exists but is not flowing, which cuts both ways. (E) PROCESSING MANDATE TIMING: Ghana's 50% local processing mandate applies to the 2026/27 season, not the current season. Treating it as a near-term supply constraint is temporally imprecise. REVISED ANALYSIS: The evidence base confirms ongoing institutional and logistical stress in both primary origins, but the bullish interpretation requires more qualification. (1) IVORY COAST: The CCC premium reduction and resumed sales represent a partial normalization of trade flows, which is at minimum neutral and potentially mildly bearish for short-term global price pressure. The farmgate cut, if implemented, may incentivize local farmers to withhold beans or reduce inputs \u2014 a lagged supply risk \u2014 but the near-term effect of unblocking 200,000 MT of accumulated beans entering the market is bearish. These two forces partially cancel. (2) BRAZIL IMPORT BAN: Materially relevant if confirmed by primary sources, but its global price impact depends on Brazil's share of Ivorian export volume, which was not quantified. Brazil is not a top-tier cocoa importer; the trade diversion effect may be modest. (3) GHANA LIQUIDITY: The $650-750M bank debt is a documented supply chain risk, but COCOBOD's disbursement partially offsets this. Net impairment to flow is real but unquantified. (4) PROCESSING MANDATE: Applicable to 2026/27 only; should not be weighted as a near-term price driver. OVERALL: The bullish framework retains validity due to cumulative supply-side dysfunction, but the prior confidence level of 0.87 is overstated given unverified sources, the bearish offset from resumed Ivorian sales, the forward-dated processing mandate, and the absence of demand-side data. A more defensible posture is moderately bullish with explicit uncertainty around near-term flow normalization.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

[2026-02-25] ICE cocoa inventories rose to a 5.75-month high of 2,150,953 bags, up from 2,111,554 bags on February 20 \u2014 a week-over-week increase of ~39,399 bags (Source: Nasdaq). 2. [2026-02-20] European port stocks held flat at 35,730 tons with no redistribution across Antwerp or Hamburg, indicating the inventory build is concentrated in the US delivery system (Source: CocoaIntel). 3. [2026-02-26] Cocoa prices at approximately $3,059/MT, down ~31% over the prior month (Source: Trading Economics). 4. [2026-01-23] ICCO reported global cocoa stocks rose 4.2% YoY to 1.1 million metric tonnes (Source: Palmetto Grain Brokerage / ICCO). 5. StoneX forecasts a 287,000 MT global surplus for 2025/26; European Q4 2025 grindings fell 8.3% YoY (Source: StoneX / raw research, undated). CRITIQUE FLAGS: (a) The ICCO data point is from January 23 \u2014 over a month stale relative to the February 25 ICE reading, reducing its confirmatory weight. (b) StoneX surplus forecast is undated in the raw research, limiting auditability. (c) The causal link between rising ICE stocks and the 31% price decline may involve confounding factors not captured here (e.g., macro risk-off, currency effects, speculative positioning unwinds) \u2014 false causation risk is non-trivial. (d) Confirmation bias risk: all five evidence points align bearishly; no bullish counterweights (e.g., potential mid-crop shortfall, La Nina weather risk, seasonal demand recovery) were examined or explicitly ruled out.\n[ANALYSIS]: The operational signal 'ICE Certified Stocks INCREASING = BEARISH' is supported by a consistent, multi-source evidence stack, but the analysis carries identifiable weaknesses that warrant a confidence reduction. On the bullish side of the ledger: no counterevidence was surfaced or explicitly falsified. The absence of a bullish data point in this packet is not proof that none exists \u2014 mid-crop production risks in West Africa (a known seasonal variable) are unaddressed, and any La Nina-linked supply disruption could rapidly invert the surplus thesis. This is a structural omission, not a minor caveat. On the bearish side: the ICE certification cycle is measurably accelerating (39,399 bags WoW), not plateauing; European port stocks show no compensating drawdown; and the 31% price decline is consistent with a market pricing in excess deliverable supply. However, the price-inventory causal arrow is not cleanly established \u2014 speculative positioning, macro risk sentiment, and currency dynamics are plausible co-drivers of the price move that cannot be excluded with available data. The ICCO macro figure (January 23) and the undated StoneX forecast provide directional corroboration but lack the recency to serve as primary signals. Net assessment: the bearish signal is well-grounded in exchange-level and price data but is analytically incomplete due to the absence of falsification attempts against bullish scenarios. Confidence is moderated accordingly from the original 0.92 to a MODERATE-HIGH level. Sentiment tag BEARISH is retained as the dominant read but is qualified by unexamined tail risks.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Additional context: Barry Callebaut reported 22% sales drop indicating demand destruction.\n[ANALYSIS]: Bearish X sentiment corroborated by sharp price declines to multi-year lows (66-77% from 2025 peaks), elevated inventories signaling oversupply, forecasted global surplus from West African production recovery, weakening demand (e.g., Barry Callebaut sales drop), and farmgate price reductions in key producers to stimulate offloading amid excess supply.

(source: International Cocoa Organization / USDA estimates)\n[ANALYSIS]: The CCH26 price of $2,957 remains 21% below the 200-day SMA of 3,730.77, confirming a sustained bearish long-term trend amid a forecasted global surplus of 287,000 MT for 2025/26, where supply is expected to outpace demand. Nearby support at 3,000 and 2,850 could test further downside if breached, while resistance at 3,255 and 3,480 limits rebounds. The daily RSI of 45.22 signals neutral momentum, and the recent 3-day RSI dip below 20 suggests short-term oversold conditions with possible bullish divergence (lower price lows against higher RSI lows), potentially easing selling pressure. However, Ivory Coast's mid-crop acceleration and farmer price cuts bolster supply dynamics, likely capping any upside unless a clear break above 3,255 confirms reversal; overall, bearish fundamentals dominate without stronger demand evidence.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
