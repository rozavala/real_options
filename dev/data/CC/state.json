It also failed to explicitly tie its claims to the provided dates. The bearish sentiment, however, was well-justified by the surplus and inventory data. REVISED ANALYSIS: While the EUR/USD 12-month forecast of 1.21 [2026-02-26] implies a stronger Euro and pegged CFA franc (XOF), which could marginally support European purchasing power, this currency dynamic is entirely overshadowed by bearish physical fundamentals. As noted in the [Raw Data], the market is grappling with a projected global surplus of 287,000 MT and severe 'demand destruction,' which has already slashed prices by over 30% in the past month. This demand collapse is physically evidenced by ICE cocoa inventories swelling to a 5.75-month high of 2,150,953 bags on [2026-02-25]. Buyers are actively refusing to purchase at Ivory Coast's official farmgate price of 2,800 CFA francs/kg. Consequently, as reported on [2026-02-19], Ivory Coast is under immense pressure to capitulate and potentially match Ghana's 28.6% price reduction before the March 31 deadline. The convergence of swelling exchange inventories, a massive structural surplus, and imminent capitulation on official farmgate prices solidifies a highly bearish outlook.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

No confirmation bias, as evidence mixed (Ivory Coast supply down YoY but steady weekly flows building stocks: arrivals 1.307M > exports 1.011M). Sources specific and dated, not vague. Bearish sentiment justified by supply stability/stock build amid weaker demand (grindings -8.3% YoY), outweighing Ghana liquidity risks (potential bullish supply constraint, unconfirmed at ports) and minor Brazil outlet loss; however, argument from silence on queues/dwell times slightly weakens claim of 'no bottlenecks' (absence of evidence \u2260 evidence of absence).\n\nRevised: Ivory Coast port arrivals steady (12k MT/week Abidjan) with cumulative down 4.5% YoY but exceeding exports (-2.8% YoY), implying stock accumulation without reported congestion/queues/dwell issues. Demand weak per European grindings plunge. Ghana buyer liquidity crisis risks upstream supply delays (potentially bullish) but lacks port-level confirmation; Brazil suspension minor.

        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: 1. [2026-02-25] ICE cocoa inventories rose to a 5.75-month high of 2,150,953 bags amid a lack of international buyers for physical beans (Source: Nasdaq / Barchart). 2. [2026-02-20] US ICE certified stocks reached 485,694 bags, with total US ICE stocks at 2,111,554 bags, representing a continued uninterrupted build since early February (Source: CocoaIntel). 3. [2026-02-20] Pending grading lots climbed to 1,958, signaling further imminent additions to certified inventory beyond the current 5.75-month high (Source: CocoaIntel). 4. [2026-02-20] European port stocks held stable at 35,730 tons with no material redistribution across Antwerp or Hamburg, confirming the inventory build remains concentrated in the US delivery system (Source: CocoaIntel). 5. [2026-02-22] Cumulative Ivory Coast cocoa port arrivals reached 1.31 MMT for the current marketing year, down 3.7% year-over-year (Source: Nasdaq).\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: Three weaknesses are identified. First, confirmation bias is present: the prior analysis systematically weighted all bearish indicators at face value while dismissing the 3.7% YoY Ivory Coast arrival decline with a single sentence and no quantitative framing. A 3.7% supply shortfall at origin, while not dominant, is non-trivial and warrants at least a probability-weighted counterargument rather than summary dismissal. Second, the operational rule 'ICE Certified Stocks INCREASING = BEARISH' is applied mechanically without acknowledging that certified stock builds can sometimes precede squeeze conditions if demand reasserts \u2014 the rule is directionally reliable but not unconditional. Third, the claim that 'cocoa prices have hit multi-year lows' is cited as price-level confirmation but no specific price level or source is attributed, which is a sourcing gap that weakens evidentiary integrity. REVISED ANALYSIS: The dominant signal remains bearish. ICE certified stocks extended their build to 2,150,953 bags as of February 25 (Nasdaq/Barchart), a verified multi-month high up ~39,399 bags from the February 20 reading of 2,111,554 bags (CocoaIntel). The pipeline of 1,958 pending grading lots (CocoaIntel, Feb 20) confirms the build trajectory has not yet plateaued. European port stocks at 35,730 tons (CocoaIntel, Feb 20) are flat, ruling out a compensating drawdown in the Atlantic basin. The 'lack of international buyers' characterization from Nasdaq/Barchart provides demand-side context for why certified stocks are accumulating rather than being absorbed. The 3.7% YoY decline in Ivory Coast arrivals (Nasdaq, Feb 22) is a legitimate bearish counterweight to note: at 1.31 MMT cumulative, this shortfall could tighten nearby supply if it accelerates, but at current magnitude it does not offset exchange-level surplus evidence. The unsourced price-level claim from the prior analysis is removed pending attribution. Net assessment: the weight of sourced, timestamped evidence supports a bearish directional bias, but the confidence ceiling is moderated from 0.88 to reflect the unsourced price confirmation gap and the non-zero probability that origin supply softness escalates into a bullish catalyst. Confidence is assessed as MODERATE-to-HIGH rather than near-certain.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

The original analysis shows mild recency bias by emphasizing recent announcements and price drops without fully weighing potential countervailing factors like weather risks or long-term demand recovery. No clear confirmation bias, but false causation is present in loosely attributing the price drop solely to Ivory Coast's actions without isolating other market drivers. 2. All claims are tied to specific, dated sources, avoiding vagueness; however, the mention of Ghana's issues and demand destruction was somewhat generalized without a direct citation. 3. The bearish sentiment tag is justified by the evidence of falling prices, rising inventories, and policy-driven surplus, though it could be tempered by acknowledging market volatility.\n\nRevised Analysis: The -1.70% hourly decline in the CCK6 contract reflects bearish pressures from Ivory Coast's mid-crop advancement and 70% farmgate price cuts, aimed at clearing a projected 200,000-ton unsold stockpile amid rising ICE inventories to 2.15 million bags\u2014a 5.75-month high. These factors, supported by a 31% monthly price drop to $3,059/MT, indicate short-term oversupply, though a 3.7% y/y decline in arrivals suggests some supply constraints; Ghana's liquidity issues add regional uncertainty but do not directly drive the current move. Overall, this points to a bearish near-term outlook with potential for surplus in 2025/26, balanced against possible demand-side rebounds.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

While structurally high IV and rich premiums with contango skew reflect some embedded long-term supply risks, the downward-sloping term structure (front-month > back-month IV) and dominant surplus signals point to continued bearish pressure without evidence of imminent reversal.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
