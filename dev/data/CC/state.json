It also failed to explicitly tie its claims to the provided dates. The bearish sentiment, however, was well-justified by the surplus and inventory data. REVISED ANALYSIS: While the EUR/USD 12-month forecast of 1.21 [2026-02-26] implies a stronger Euro and pegged CFA franc (XOF), which could marginally support European purchasing power, this currency dynamic is entirely overshadowed by bearish physical fundamentals. As noted in the [Raw Data], the market is grappling with a projected global surplus of 287,000 MT and severe 'demand destruction,' which has already slashed prices by over 30% in the past month. This demand collapse is physically evidenced by ICE cocoa inventories swelling to a 5.75-month high of 2,150,953 bags on [2026-02-25]. Buyers are actively refusing to purchase at Ivory Coast's official farmgate price of 2,800 CFA francs/kg. Consequently, as reported on [2026-02-19], Ivory Coast is under immense pressure to capitulate and potentially match Ghana's 28.6% price reduction before the March 31 deadline. The convergence of swelling exchange inventories, a massive structural surplus, and imminent capitulation on official farmgate prices solidifies a highly bearish outlook.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

No confirmation bias, as evidence mixed (Ivory Coast supply down YoY but steady weekly flows building stocks: arrivals 1.307M > exports 1.011M). Sources specific and dated, not vague. Bearish sentiment justified by supply stability/stock build amid weaker demand (grindings -8.3% YoY), outweighing Ghana liquidity risks (potential bullish supply constraint, unconfirmed at ports) and minor Brazil outlet loss; however, argument from silence on queues/dwell times slightly weakens claim of 'no bottlenecks' (absence of evidence \u2260 evidence of absence).\n\nRevised: Ivory Coast port arrivals steady (12k MT/week Abidjan) with cumulative down 4.5% YoY but exceeding exports (-2.8% YoY), implying stock accumulation without reported congestion/queues/dwell issues. Demand weak per European grindings plunge. Ghana buyer liquidity crisis risks upstream supply delays (potentially bullish) but lacks port-level confirmation; Brazil suspension minor.

[2026-02-20] US ICE certified stocks reached 485,694 bags, with total US ICE stocks at 2,111,554 bags, representing a continued uninterrupted build since early February (Source: CocoaIntel). 3. [2026-02-20] Pending grading lots climbed to 1,958, signaling further imminent additions to certified inventory beyond the current 5.75-month high (Source: CocoaIntel). 4. [2026-02-20] European port stocks held stable at 35,730 tons with no material redistribution across Antwerp or Hamburg, confirming the inventory build remains concentrated in the US delivery system (Source: CocoaIntel). 5. [2026-02-22] Cumulative Ivory Coast cocoa port arrivals reached 1.31 MMT for the current marketing year, down 3.7% year-over-year (Source: Nasdaq).\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: Three weaknesses are identified. First, confirmation bias is present: the prior analysis systematically weighted all bearish indicators at face value while dismissing the 3.7% YoY Ivory Coast arrival decline with a single sentence and no quantitative framing. A 3.7% supply shortfall at origin, while not dominant, is non-trivial and warrants at least a probability-weighted counterargument rather than summary dismissal. Second, the operational rule 'ICE Certified Stocks INCREASING = BEARISH' is applied mechanically without acknowledging that certified stock builds can sometimes precede squeeze conditions if demand reasserts \u2014 the rule is directionally reliable but not unconditional. Third, the claim that 'cocoa prices have hit multi-year lows' is cited as price-level confirmation but no specific price level or source is attributed, which is a sourcing gap that weakens evidentiary integrity. REVISED ANALYSIS: The dominant signal remains bearish. ICE certified stocks extended their build to 2,150,953 bags as of February 25 (Nasdaq/Barchart), a verified multi-month high up ~39,399 bags from the February 20 reading of 2,111,554 bags (CocoaIntel). The pipeline of 1,958 pending grading lots (CocoaIntel, Feb 20) confirms the build trajectory has not yet plateaued. European port stocks at 35,730 tons (CocoaIntel, Feb 20) are flat, ruling out a compensating drawdown in the Atlantic basin. The 'lack of international buyers' characterization from Nasdaq/Barchart provides demand-side context for why certified stocks are accumulating rather than being absorbed. The 3.7% YoY decline in Ivory Coast arrivals (Nasdaq, Feb 22) is a legitimate bearish counterweight to note: at 1.31 MMT cumulative, this shortfall could tighten nearby supply if it accelerates, but at current magnitude it does not offset exchange-level surplus evidence. The unsourced price-level claim from the prior analysis is removed pending attribution. Net assessment: the weight of sourced, timestamped evidence supports a bearish directional bias, but the confidence ceiling is moderated from 0.88 to reflect the unsourced price confirmation gap and the non-zero probability that origin supply softness escalates into a bullish catalyst. Confidence is assessed as MODERATE-to-HIGH rather than near-certain.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Prices at multi-year lows reflect weak physical demand and favorable weather improving supply outlooks, creating a bearish imbalance favoring surplus.

No major logical fallacies identified; the analysis avoids confirmation bias by incorporating both short-term price uptick and long-term downtrend, recency bias by referencing monthly and 200-day data, and false causation by linking bearish signals to supply evidence without unsubstantiated claims. 2. All claims are backed by specific, dated sources with no vagueness. 3. The bearish sentiment tag is justified by the price's significant deviation below the 200-day SMA, rising inventories indicating surplus, and confirmatory technical indicators showing 'Strong Sell' without bullish signals. Revised Analysis: The cocoa price at 3,075.63 USD/T remains about 18% below the 200-day SMA of 3,730.77, reinforcing a sustained downtrend characterized by lower highs and lows, primarily due to ample supply as shown by ICE inventories hitting a 5.25-month peak of 2,111,554 bags and broader market projections of global surplus. Technicals align with bearish momentum via a 'Strong Sell' rating, RSI at 45.225 (neutral but not oversold enough for reversal), and MACD at -0.68 signaling continued weakness. Near-term support at 3,046-3,038 USD/T is at risk of breach, while resistance at 3,067 USD/T limits rebounds, suggesting supply pressures outweigh demand absent any emerging bullish indicators.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

While structurally high IV and rich premiums with contango skew reflect some embedded long-term supply risks, the downward-sloping term structure (front-month > back-month IV) and dominant surplus signals point to continued bearish pressure without evidence of imminent reversal.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
