The revised analysis relies strictly on the provided evidence. Agronomic conditions in West Africa are highly favorable for the upcoming mid-crop, directly supported by the Ghana Meteorological Agency's forecast of an early rainy season and Tropical General Investments Group's reports of larger, healthier pods. Furthermore, Ivory Coast is facing a severe commercial oversupply, evidenced by its unprecedented policy shift to reclassify March cocoa to drastically slash farm-gate prices from 2,800 CFA to 800-1,000 CFA to clear excess stock. The convergence of excellent weather boosting future yields and a massive backlog of current inventory has already driven prices to multi-year lows, justifying a strongly bearish outlook without the need for unsubstantiated claims.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

However, it suffered from recency bias by assuming the unlocking of this inventory will indefinitely crash prices, ignoring that a massive 28.17% MoM drop likely already prices in much of this anticipated supply glut. The impending 35% farmgate price cut in Ivory Coast, following Ghana's 28.6% reduction, will indeed flush short-term physical supply into the market, maintaining immediate bearish pressure. Yet, such severe cuts to farmer compensation will likely disincentivize future crop maintenance and fertilizer use, capping long-term downside risk. While the short-term sentiment remains bearish due to the imminent inventory release, the downside velocity is expected to decelerate as the market absorbs the unlocked stock.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Injecting this massive volume of physical supply into the market at heavily discounted prices exerts strong downward pressure on near-term global prices. Furthermore, the prior analysis introduced an unverified external figure (2,800 CFA) not present in the provided text. However, the bearish short-term supply dump is counterbalanced by severe long-term structural risks. Ghana's $750 million buyer debt, reliance on untested domestic bonds, and drastic producer price cuts signal a systemic liquidity crisis that threatens future crop procurement and farm maintenance. Brazil's import ban further complicates global trade flows. Ultimately, the market faces a tug-of-war between immediate bearish stock liquidation and bullish long-term supply chain deterioration, warranting a neutral near-term outlook.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: 1. [2026-02-26] ICE cocoa inventories rose to a 5.75-month high of 2,150,953 bags, driven by weak buying interest and aggressive certification activity (Source: Barchart / Nasdaq). 2. [2026-02-27] Cocoa prices fell to $2,981.14 USD/T, a 2.56% single-day decline and a 28.17% drop over the prior month (Source: Trading Economics). 3. [2026-02-25] Open interest for cocoa futures at ICE rose by 3,867 contracts to 177,313 contracts total (Source: StoneX). 4. [2026-02-20] European port stocks remained broadly stable at 35,730 tons with no material redistribution across Antwerp or Hamburg (Source: CocoaIntel). 5. StoneX and ICCO confirm a shift to a global surplus regime, with StoneX forecasting a 287,000 MT surplus for the 2025/26 season; West African origin markets face unsold bean accumulation due to buyer resistance at official farm-gate prices (Source: StoneX / ICCO raw research).\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: (1) Logical Fallacies Identified: The prior analysis committed moderate confirmation bias \u2014 every data point was interpreted exclusively through a bearish lens without stress-testing alternative explanations. For example, rising open interest alongside falling prices is classically bearish, but it could also reflect hedging activity by physical merchants locking in prices at a perceived floor, which would be neutral-to-bullish for forward demand. The prior analysis dismissed this alternative without justification. Additionally, the 28.17% monthly price decline was cited as a 'direct price-discovery response' to inventory build \u2014 this is a false causation risk, as the price collapse may also reflect macro risk-off sentiment, USD strength, or position unwinding by speculative funds that entered during the 2024 supply-crisis rally, none of which were ruled out. (2) Source Quality: Sources are adequately specific by date and origin (Barchart, Trading Economics, StoneX, CocoaIntel, ICCO), which is a strength. However, the European port stock figure (35,730 tons) is dated February 20 \u2014 six days older than the ICE data \u2014 creating a temporal mismatch that weakens the 'no offsetting drawdown' claim. The farm-gate buyer resistance claim lacks a specific date or quantified volume, reducing its evidential weight. (3) Sentiment Justification: The BEARISH tag is directionally justified by the convergence of rising certified stocks, a multi-week price collapse, a credible surplus forecast, and static European stocks. However, the confidence of 0.92 was overstated given the unaddressed alternative interpretations of open interest and the absence of demand-side data (e.g., grind data, forward purchase commitments by confectioners) that could signal a price floor. REVISED ANALYSIS: The weight of evidence remains bearish. ICE certified stocks have traced a clear upward trajectory \u2014 1,942,367 bags (Feb 17) \u2192 2,111,554 bags (Feb 20) \u2192 2,150,953 bags (Feb 26) \u2014 with the pace of accumulation showing no deceleration. The sub-$3,000/T price level represents a psychologically and technically significant breakdown from the 2024 highs above $10,000/T, consistent with a structural regime change from deficit to surplus. The StoneX 287,000 MT surplus forecast provides macro validation. However, three material uncertainties constrain confidence: (a) Open interest growth may reflect hedging rather than purely speculative short positioning \u2014 this cannot be confirmed from the available data alone. (b) No current grind or demand absorption data is present in the evidence set; a demand response to sub-$3,000/T prices could be forming and is unobserved. (c) European port stock data is dated and cannot confirm whether Atlantic-basin drawdowns have occurred in the intervening six days. Net assessment: Bearish structural trend is well-supported; confidence is moderated from 0.92 to reflect genuine interpretive uncertainty on open interest and absent demand-side data.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

[2026-02-27] Key support for CCH27 is at 4,327 (S1), with resistance at 4,512 (R1) (Barchart). [2026-02-26] The 200-day SMA for benchmark US Cocoa futures is 3,673.78, with broader technicals showing a 'Strong Sell' and a 7-week downtrend driven by robust supplies and slack demand (Investing.com, Barchart).\n[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis contained logical flaws, notably hallucinating a MACD value (-3.93) not present in the evidence and relying on an unsupported generalization about 'past market behavior' to force a neutral, contrarian conclusion. A strictly evidence-based analysis indicates that the cocoa market is in a definitive 7-week downtrend driven by bearish fundamentals (robust supplies and slack demand) and confirmed by 'Strong Sell' technicals. CCH27 is trading at 4,432, which remains significantly above the benchmark 200-day SMA of 3,673.78, suggesting structural room for further downside. While the RSI of 36.19 is approaching oversold territory, it has not yet crossed the standard 30 threshold, and the price is still above the primary support level of 4,327. Prematurely calling a bottom based on an approaching support level constitutes contrarian bias; until support holds or fundamentals shift, the trend remains decidedly bearish.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Sources are specific with dates/numbers. Bearish sentiment justified by supply/demand imbalance indicators and falling IV signaling normalization. Minor weakness: price lows and prior IV peaks inferred but not explicitly cited\u2014addressed by sticking closely to evidence. Rising inventories and surplus forecasts indicate abundant supply pressuring a market with weakened demand; declining IV (higher near-term vs. lower long-term) and cheaper premiums reflect reduced volatility expectations in an oversupplied, normalizing environment.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.55\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
