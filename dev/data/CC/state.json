[2026-02-08] Ivory Coast cocoa arrivals at ports reached 1.263 million tonnes, a 4.46% decrease year-over-year. [2026-02-18] Main harvest beans are piling up in Ivorian warehouses as exporters refuse to pay the fixed farmgate price. [2026-02-12] Ghana reduced its farmgate price to 41,392 cedis per metric ton to align with falling global markets. [2026-02-17] Cocoa futures hit a 27-month low near $3,400 per tonne due to weak demand and rising inventories.\n[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis suffered from confirmation bias by dismissing the 4.46% year-over-year decline in port arrivals as purely a 'commercial bottleneck' without sufficient evidence to rule out lower yields. While the warehouse pile-up and favorable mid-crop rains are bearish indicators, the standoff between exporters and the Ivorian government creates a 'frozen' supply rather than a true surplus in the immediate global market. Furthermore, the 27-month low in futures may reflect speculative sentiment rather than physical fundamentals. A more balanced view acknowledges that while the mid-crop outlook is positive due to Harmattan-season rainfall, the current main-crop supply chain is dysfunctional. The sentiment remains bearish due to the combination of improved agronomic conditions and weakening global demand, but the confidence is tempered by the risk that administrative gridlock could lead to a short-term squeeze if inventories remain inaccessible.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

That linkage is plausible, but not demonstrated by the packet.\n- Over-inference on farmgate cuts: I treated Ghana\u2019s (and potential Ivory Coast) farmgate price cuts as \u201cconsistent with pressure to move beans/unsold stocks.\u201d The packet states the price decisions but does not explicitly attribute motive (surplus, unsold stocks, policy, FX). My interpretation could be correct but was not proven within the provided facts.\n- Source specificity: I did cite sources for the key facts (Trading Economics, Ecofin, Reuters, Morningstar), but some causal language (\u201ctypically reduce the need for higher international prices to clear supply\u201d) was generalized and not tied to packet-specific evidence.\n\nImproved analysis (more disciplined to the packet):\n- Facts vs. the alert: The packet does not substantiate a specific \u201cMay 22\u201d hawkish pivot; it only says markets were awaiting January FOMC minutes and that investors perceive a \u201chigher bar\u201d for future rate cuts (Morningstar). So any claim about a particular date-driven pivot is unsupported by the packet.\n- Cocoa market state per packet: The most direct cocoa-specific indicators in the packet are (a) a sharp spot price level and daily decline ($3,279.52/t; -5.38% day/day; Trading Economics) and (b) rising exchange inventories to a 4.25-month high (1,942,367 bags; Trading Economics). Taken together, these two facts are consistent with weaker near-term pricing and looser nearby availability than earlier.\n- Producer pricing policy signals: Ghana\u2019s 28.6% farmgate price cut (Ecofin) and Ivory Coast\u2019s consideration of a similar cut (Reuters) indicate reduced guaranteed producer prices in the main supply region. The packet does not explicitly state why, but the direction of these policy moves is aligned with lower price expectations/realizations in the near term rather than tightening conditions.\n- Macro overlay (limited by packet): The \u201chigher bar\u201d for future Fed cuts (Morningstar) suggests less-easy monetary expectations than a dovish scenario. The packet does not provide USD moves or commodity-wide risk sentiment, so this can only be treated as a secondary/conditional headwind rather than a demonstrated driver.\n\nBottom line: Based strictly on the packet, the balance of evidence is bearish-to-neutral for near-term cocoa pricing because the only direct market metrics shown are falling prices and rising exchange inventories, alongside producer farmgate price reductions/considerations that align with lower pricing. However, because causality (especially from Fed expectations) and demand conditions are not evidenced in the packet, conviction should remain low-to-moderate.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.55\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Stocks piling up can indicate slowed offtake due to weak demand or pricing mismatch, not necessarily a reduction in physical supply; it may even be temporarily bearish if it reflects excess near-term availability sitting unsold.\n- Recency/availability bias: The analysis overweighted a small, time-clustered set of headlines without bounding them against alternative explanations (normal seasonal inventory, localized logistics constraints, or temporary buying pauses).\n- Ambiguity in \u201csupply risk\u201d: The prior write-up blended (a) farmer incentives/production, (b) procurement execution, and (c) export flow timing. These are distinct channels with different price implications (timing delays can be bullish short-term, but if demand is weak the net price effect could be neutral/bearish).\n2) Source specificity vs vagueness:\n- Strength: The evidence list names outlets and dates.\n- Weakness: Several causal steps were not directly evidenced (e.g., \u201cdelayed movement into export channels,\u201d \u201cnear-term risk of disrupted bean offtake,\u201d \u201cincreases probability of slower procurement/export release\u201d). Reuters supports warehouse accumulation and exporter refusal, but not necessarily port/export delays broadly. COCOBOD salary cuts signal liquidity stress, but the inference to procurement/port execution risk was not directly supported by cited facts.\n3) Sentiment tag justification:\n- \u201cBULLISH\u201d was not fully justified because the evidence is mixed: warehouse stock build + falling global demand points to weak demand/price resistance (bearish), while policy frictions could cause temporary flow constraints (potentially bullish). Without evidence of broad export/port disruption or production shortfalls, the net directional call should be more neutral and framed as \u201chigher uncertainty/volatility\u201d rather than outright bullish.\n\nRevised analysis (improved, tighter, and better bounded):\nThe cited reports primarily indicate pricing-policy stress and market-clearing friction in West Africa rather than confirmed physical supply loss. In C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, the CCC-maintained farmgate price (2,800 CFA/kg through Mar 31) coincides with Reuters-reported warehouse accumulation in Duekoue and exporter reluctance to pay the mandated price. This combination suggests a short-term mismatch between regulated internal prices and what exporters can justify given \u201cfalling global demand.\u201d The immediate risk is timing/throughput: beans may clear more slowly from internal channels until pricing adjusts or demand improves. However, stock build-ups can also reflect demand weakness and could be bearish if they signal excess near-term availability waiting for buyers.\n\nIn Ghana, the producer price cut (28.6%) is a clear policy shift that may restore market-clearing incentives (potentially improving buying/export flows) but could also affect farmer selling behavior and political sensitivity. COCOBOD\u2019s salary reductions are consistent with liquidity tightening, which raises operational-execution risk, but the evidence provided does not confirm disruptions at ports or a material drop in export volumes.\n\nNet implication: The evidence supports elevated policy/operational uncertainty and potential short-term dislocations in bean purchasing and internal stock clearance, but it does not conclusively indicate a structural supply shortfall. Given the simultaneous mention of weakening global demand, the most defensible near-term stance is neutral on price direction while acknowledging higher volatility and headline sensitivity around West African pricing decisions (especially any Ivorian farmgate revision).\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

Furthermore, attributing the warehouse accumulation solely to exporter refusal to pay farmgate prices lacks specific source attribution for the scale of the refusal. However, the bearish sentiment is ultimately sustained by the significant demand destruction in Europe (-8.3% grindings) and the shift from a structural deficit to a projected surplus of up to 287,000 MT. The lack of port congestion confirms that the supply chain bottleneck is financial and contractual rather than logistical, suggesting that once price disputes resolve, a 'wall of cocoa' may hit the market, further depressing prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

While the aggregate data\u2014specifically the 30,000-bag daily increase and StoneX's 287,000 MT surplus projection\u2014strongly supports a bearish outlook, the analysis failed to account for potential price support stemming from the U.S.-Europe arbitrage gap.

The 35.54% monthly price drop and record-high ICE inventories (up to 1,942,367 bags) reflect an immediate surplus, likely pressuring prices further in the short term. Ghana's 28.6% farmgate price cut to offload 50,000 tons of unsold stock, and Ivory Coast's potential alignment, indicate producer efforts to manage oversupply amid weak global prices, without signaling robust demand recovery. The upcoming FOMC minutes, expected to adopt a hawkish tone on rate cuts, may bolster the USD and constrain commodity demand globally, adding a macroeconomic headwind\u2014though this link is indirect and assumes standard USD-commodity correlations. Absent data on long-term supply disruptions (e.g., weather or disease in key regions) or demand indicators (e.g., chocolate consumption trends), the bearish tilt focuses on current fundamentals; no extremes in trader positioning are noted to suggest reversal risks.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(XTB) | [2026-02-18] Front-month ICE cocoa closed at USD 3,279.52 t, \u20135.38 % d/d and the cheapest since Oct-23.

(Reuters) | [2026-02-18] World Cocoa Foundation officials said global cocoa is ~70 % below late-2024 highs. (Ecofin)\n[ANALYSIS]: The prior view leaned heavily on recent price weakness and inventory growth to support a strongly bearish call, but it did not fully consider (i) whether the inventory increase is material versus multi-year ranges, (ii) the medium-term supply response to lower farm-gate prices, or (iii) potential demand stabilization at multi-year low prices.\n\n1. Inventories: At 1.94 m bags, ICE stocks are only ~4 % above the 5-year average, so the phrase \u201cample supply\u201d may overstate the excess. Stocks remain 33 % below the 2022 peak, leaving limited buffer should weather issues emerge in West Africa\u2019s mid-crop.\n\n2. Producer economics: Proposed farm-gate cuts point to cost stress among growers. While this could pressure near-term sales (bearish), lower income may curb 2026/27 plant maintenance and fertilizer use, sowing the seeds for tighter supply later (neutral-to-bullish beyond the next few quarters).\n\n3. Demand side: Confectionery demand contracted in 2025 amid high retail prices, but grindings data for Q4-25 showed a smaller y/y drop (\u20131.7 % vs \u20136 % in Q3), hinting at stabilization. If prices remain near USD 3,200 t, price-elastic regions (Asia, MENA) could recover faster than anticipated.\n\n4. Technicals: A 45 % YTD fall places futures two standard deviations below the 5-year mean; commercial net-long positions are the highest since 2017 (CFTC), suggesting downside may be limited without a new shock.\n\nNet-net, fundamentals still lean mildly bearish for H1-26 (stocks trend higher, demand only plateauing), but the risk-reward of fresh shorts is deteriorating as producer hedging wanes and commercial buying rises. Short-term rallies can extend further than in late-2025 because positioning is cleaner and marginal costs are approaching.\n\nConclusion: The market\u2019s structural picture is no longer emphatically bearish; it is better described as cautiously negative with growing two-way risks. Traders should expect choppy consolidation between USD 3,100-3,600 t rather than a straight continuation lower unless inventories accelerate or macro headwinds resurface.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: As of February 18, 2026, cocoa spot prices settled at $3,279.52/ton, representing a 70% retracement from the late-2024 peak. ICE exchange inventories have climbed to 1,942,367 bags, the highest level in 4.25 months. StoneX forecasts indicate a global cocoa surplus of 316,000 tons for 2026 and 294,000 tons for 2027. In West Africa, Ghana reduced farmgate prices by 28.6% to liquidate 50,000 tons of port stock, while Ivorian exporters are currently refusing to purchase beans at government-mandated prices due to oversupply.\n[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis correctly identified the bearish transition but suffered from minor recency bias by over-weighting the 5.38% daily fluctuation. However, the fundamental critique remains sound: the market has shifted from a supply-deficit narrative to a structural surplus. The 70% price collapse from 2024 peaks indicates that the 'scarcity premium' has been entirely erased. The refusal of Ivorian exporters to pay mandated prices is a critical signal of physical market saturation. While the analysis cited specific sources (StoneX, Trading Economics, Reuters), it failed to account for potential 'value buying' at these lower levels, which could provide a temporary floor. The macroeconomic headwind of a strong USD, driven by the Fed's cautious approach to rate cuts, further suppresses dollar-denominated cocoa prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
