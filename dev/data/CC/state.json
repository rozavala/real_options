[2026-02-20] Ivory Coast cocoa arrivals reached 1.30 MMT (Oct 1-Feb 15), a 3% decrease from the previous year (Source: Nasdaq).\n[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis contained a logical flaw by introducing unsupported claims about 'faltering global grinding demand' and 'demand destruction' which were not present in the provided evidence. A revised, strictly evidence-based assessment maintains a bearish outlook driven by projected oversupply. According to Nasdaq, West African pod counts are 7% above the five-year average, directly supporting StoneX's forecast of a substantial 287,000 MT global surplus for the 2025/26 season. Physical market distress is already evident in Ghana, where accumulating unsold warehouse stocks and declining global prices forced a nearly 30% reduction in farmgate prices (Food Business Africa). While Ivory Coast port arrivals are currently lagging slightly by 3% year-over-year (Nasdaq), the overwhelming biological yield indicators and regional warehouse stock accumulations point to a well-supplied market, justifying a bearish stance without needing to assume unverified demand destruction.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(Trading Economics)\n- [2026-02-20] March ICE NY cocoa closed down ~8% at $3,058/tonne, the lowest since May 2023, extending a six-week selloff. (Nasdaq / Barchart)\n- [2026-02-19] ICE cocoa inventories reached a 5-month high of 2,065,040 bags; buyers reportedly reluctant to purchase at official prices in West Africa. (Nasdaq)\n- [2026-02-16] C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s CCC kept its farmgate price at 2,800,000 CFA francs per 64kg bag until March 31, 2026. (MyJoyOnline)\n- [2026-02-12] Ghana cut cocoa producer price by 28.6% (from GH\u00a23,625 to GH\u00a22,587 per bag). (Modern Ghana)\n[ANALYSIS]: Critique of the prior analysis:\n1) Logical fallacies / reasoning risks:\n- Potential false causation / over-attribution: The analysis implied that a one-day EUR/USD move (-0.10%) materially impacts cocoa demand. That linkage is directionally plausible for USD-priced commodities, but the magnitude and immediacy were not demonstrated with evidence in the packet.\n- Recency bias: The sharp 8% daily drop and \u201csix-week selloff\u201d were treated as decisive for demand weakness, but futures can fall for multiple reasons (macro risk-off, position unwinds, changing supply expectations). The packet supports \u201cbearish price action,\u201d but not a clean causal decomposition.\n- Confirmation bias: High inventories + price drop were interpreted primarily as demand weakness. While buyer reluctance is an explicit demand-side indicator, higher exchange inventories can also reflect supply flows or timing/logistics. The packet does not quantify grind, confectionery demand, or import volumes to confirm demand destruction.\n2) Source specificity:\n- The prior write-up did cite specific sources for each factual claim (Trading Economics, Nasdaq/Barchart, MyJoyOnline, Modern Ghana), which is good.\n- However, several key statements were necessarily inferential and should have been labeled more clearly as \u201cmechanical/possible\u201d rather than \u201cevidence of.\u201d Example: \u201cEUR weakness adds a headwind\u201d is a reasonable mechanism, but the packet provides no evidence of EUR-area buying behavior changing.\n3) Sentiment tag justification:\n- BEARISH is broadly justified by the packet\u2019s direct market indicators: a multi-week selloff, an 8% drop to the lowest since May 2023, and inventories at a 5-month high alongside reported buyer reluctance.\n- That said, the sentiment should be framed as \u201cbearish near-term\u201d rather than a strong structural bearish call, because the packet also contains a potentially supportive policy adjustment (Ghana cutting producer prices) that could help restore market clearing, and the FX forecast implies possible future EUR support for affordability.\n\nRevised analysis (improved, more cautious on causality):\n- Price/inventory signals: The most concrete indicators in the packet are bearish: March ICE NY cocoa down ~8% to $3,058/tonne (lowest since May 2023) and a six-week selloff (Nasdaq/Barchart), alongside ICE inventories at a 5-month high of 2,065,040 bags (Nasdaq). These facts indicate weak pricing momentum and/or an easing of near-term tightness as reflected in exchange stocks.\n- Demand frictions: Nasdaq explicitly notes international buyers are reluctant to purchase at official West African prices. That is direct evidence of a market-clearing problem (prices set/anchored above what buyers are currently willing to pay), consistent with inventory accumulation and downward futures pressure.\n- Policy implications: C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire maintaining its farmgate price through Mar 31, 2026 (MyJoyOnline) suggests continued price rigidity on the supply side. Ghana\u2019s 28.6% producer-price cut (Modern Ghana) is consistent with an attempt to improve competitiveness/restore flows and could reduce buyer resistance over time, but the packet provides no confirmation yet that purchases have resumed.\n- FX considerations (bounded): Cocoa is quoted in USD in the packet. A lower EUR/USD (Trading Economics) mechanically raises EUR-denominated costs for EUR buyers, but the reported one-day move (-0.10%) is small and the packet provides no purchasing data to show a measurable impact. The forecast EUR recovery (to 1.19 by end-Q1 2026; 1.22 in one year) could modestly improve affordability for EUR buyers if realized, but remains prospective and should not be treated as an active driver today.\n\nNet: The evidence supports a near-term bearish bias driven by falling futures, rising exchange inventories, and stated buyer reluctance. FX adds a plausible but unproven marginal headwind in the very near term, while Ghana\u2019s producer-price cut is a potential (not yet evidenced) stabilizer for demand/flows.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Calling it bullish risks confirmation bias (interpreting \u201crisk premium/uncertainty\u201d as bullish without evidence of supply loss).\n- False causation / weak causal chain: It implied policy resets and financing transitions can \u201cslow procurement/marketing decisions\u201d and create \u201cexport availability risk premium,\u201d but the packet contains no direct evidence of procurement delays, delivery failures, port congestion, or reduced exports. That is plausible but unproven from the cited items.\n- Recency framing: The analysis heavily weights the most recent policy headlines to infer near-term flow disruption, without balancing against the explicit CCC confirmation of price stability through Mar 31 (which, at least officially, reduces immediate uncertainty).\n\n2) Source specificity vs vagueness\n- Strength: It did cite concrete dated items and sources (Ecofin, Reuters/CitiNewsroom, MyJoyOnline/Cocoa Intel, Graphic Online, CitiNewsroom).\n- Weakness: Several conclusions were phrased generally (\u201cexecution risk,\u201d \u201ctiming uncertainty,\u201d \u201crisk premium increases\u201d) without tying them to specific observable indicators in the packet (e.g., arrears, warehouse stocks, port throughput, purchasing volumes). Those are interpretive leaps rather than sourced facts.\n\n3) Sentiment tag justification\n- Not justified as BULLISH by the provided evidence alone. A producer-price cut in Ghana and discussion of a potential cut in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are more consistent with (a) an attempt to realign domestic prices with a weaker global market and/or (b) reduced sector affordability/financing capacity. Both point toward BEARISH or at least NEUTRAL for cocoa prices unless there is separate evidence of supply disruption, smuggling constraints, hoarding, or production shortfalls (none provided here).\n\nRevised analysis (improved, tighter to evidence)\n- The dominant signal in the packet is policy/financing adjustment in two regulated marketing systems (Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), not broad political instability or confirmed physical/logistics disruption.\n- Ghana has enacted a material policy change: a 28.6% producer-price cut effective immediately (Graphic Online). Separately, Ghana plans to raise GH\u00a230 billion via a domestic syndicated bond to support COCOBOD working capital (CitiNewsroom), indicating funding pressure and an active effort to shore up liquidity.\n- C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s CCC has officially maintained the farmgate price at 2,800 CFA/kg through Mar 31, 2026 (MyJoyOnline / Cocoa Intel). However, Reuters/Ecofin report that high-level discussions are underway and \u201call options\u201d are being considered to potentially cut the farmgate price to align with Ghana (Reuters/CitiNewsroom; Ecofin). This creates policy-direction uncertainty beyond the formal CCC statement.\n- What can be concluded from the packet: near-term regulatory/pricing-policy uncertainty is elevated (especially in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Ghana is in a financing-rebalancing phase for cocoa operations. What cannot be concluded from the packet: that exports will be disrupted, that procurement will materially slow, or that physical supply will tighten\u2014those require separate operational data.\n- Market implication (within the limits of evidence): administered price cuts (actual in Ghana, contemplated in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) are consistent with a weaker pricing environment and efforts to realign farmgate economics with global conditions. On evidence provided, the directional bias is more BEARISH/NEUTRAL than bullish; any bullish \u201crisk premium\u201d claim would need corroboration of supply loss or delivery constraints.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Sharply contracting European demand (-8.3% Q4 grindings), surging ICE inventories to 5-month highs, and prices at 2.75-year lows confirm demand destruction exceeding any supply moderation, creating excess supply and bearish market dynamics.

[2026-02-20] Cocoa prices extended a six-week selloff, hitting 2.75-year nearest-futures lows with NY cocoa closing down 8% at the start of the session (Source: Nasdaq / Barchart). 2. [2026-02-18] ICE-monitored cocoa inventories rose to a 5-month high of 2,065,040 bags, reflecting a lack of buying interest (Source: Barchart). 3. [2026-02-13] ICE cocoa inventories were recorded at 1,942,367 bags, a 4.25-month high at that time (Source: Trading Economics). 4. [2026-02-10] Rabobank revised its 2025/26 global cocoa surplus estimate to 250,000 MT, down from a prior 328,000 MT forecast (Source: Nasdaq). 5. [2026-02-05] ICE London (European) inventories edged lower by 469 bags (Source: CocoaIntel).\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: Several weaknesses are identified. (1) Confirmation bias: The prior analysis selectively weighted bearish signals while immediately dismissing the Rabobank surplus revision downward (from 328,000 MT to 250,000 MT \u2014 a 24% reduction) as merely a 'nuance.' A 78,000 MT reduction in expected surplus is non-trivial and could signal improving supply-demand balance ahead, warranting more than a one-sentence acknowledgment. (2) Recency bias: Heavy weighting was given to the Feb 20 single-session 8% price drop without acknowledging that sharp single-session moves can represent capitulation or overshooting rather than trend confirmation. Treating one dramatic session as directional evidence without noting this risk is analytically incomplete. (3) False causation: The analysis implies inventory builds directly caused the price collapse, but correlation was treated as causation. Prices may have fallen due to speculative positioning unwinds, currency effects, or macro risk-off sentiment \u2014 factors not examined. (4) Vague demand-side claims: The reference to 'falling global grindings and reluctance from international buyers' was attributed to 'raw research' without a specific source citation, violating sourcing standards applied elsewhere. (5) The 0.93 confidence score was unjustifiably precise given the absence of demand-side sourcing, the unexamined surplus revision, and lack of positioning data. REVISED ASSESSMENT: The dominant trend remains bearish \u2014 inventory builds are confirmed across two data points with specific figures, price action is consistent with supply overhang, and the macro surplus backdrop is corroborated by a named institution (Rabobank). However, the Rabobank revision downward introduces a legitimate medium-term counterpoint that could signal a bottoming process. The European inventory drawdown, while small, is directionally opposite to the US trend and should not be entirely dismissed. Confidence is reduced from the prior 0.93 to HIGH (rather than EXTREME) to reflect these unresolved ambiguities. Sentiment remains BEARISH but with acknowledgment that downside momentum may be approaching exhaustion near multi-year lows.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Price collapse to multi-year lows confirms oversupply dominance. However, extreme oversold RSI (20) and crowded shorts at lows introduce contrarian risks of short-covering rally, potentially overriding fundamentals short-term; no evidence of imminent supply tightening.

Key tech: support 4,327 $/t, resistance 4,512 $/t. ICE certified stocks 2.065 m bags, 5-month high. (Barchart, Investing.com)\n[ANALYSIS]: Critique of prior view: 1) Possible confirmation bias \u2013 the write-up emphasised the bearish death-cross and rising stocks but played down the oversold RSI that could spark short-covering. 2) No logical fallacy was explicit, yet the leap from higher inventories to \u2018ample supply relative to demand\u2019 ignores demand data; correlation \u2260 causation. 3) The sources were cited specifically (Barchart, Investing.com) \u2013 adequate. 4) Sentiment tag \u2018BEARISH\u2019 was defensible but under-acknowledged the chance of a technical bounce.\n\nRe-assessment: Spot price remains deeply below both moving averages, validating a long-term down-trend. The death-cross underlines that momentum from medium- to long-term participants is negative. Fresh five-month-high exchange stocks reinforce the supply-heavy narrative, but without concurrent grind/consumption figures the surplus is assumed, not proven. Short-term momentum is stretched: RSI at ~30 signals conditions approaching oversold, and price sits just above first support (4,327 $/t). That level could attract bargain-hunters or trigger algorithmic short-covering; a close below would likely open a run toward the psychological 4,200 $/t area where small volume gaps appear on the daily chart (Sept-25 pivot zone). Conversely, a rebound toward 4,512 $/t may unfold, yet the larger trend remains down unless the market can reclaim the 50-d SMA near 5,350 $/t\u2014roughly 20 % overhead\u2014and sustain closes above it.\n\nTrading implication: Base case stays bearish while under 4,512 $/t, but risk-reward for initiating fresh shorts here is less attractive; consider waiting for a rally toward resistance or a decisive break of 4,327 $/t. Oversold momentum warrants tighter stop discipline.\n\nKey catalysts to monitor: next ICCO grind data for demand clues; West Africa mid-crop weather; any change in exchange stock trajectory.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

High IV (71.53%) and extreme put skew (45.05) reflect persistent downside hedging demand despite the sell-off, likely due to residual supply concerns; however, recency of evidence warrants caution against overextrapolation. No strong counter-evidence of demand recovery or supply disruptions observed.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
