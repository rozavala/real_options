[2026-02-20] StoneX forecasted a global cocoa surplus of 287,000 MT for the 2025/26 season (Source: Nasdaq). [2026-02-19] Ghana reduced its farmgate cocoa price by nearly 30% to 41,392 cedis per metric ton amid falling global prices and accumulating unsold warehouse stocks (Source: Food Business Africa). [2026-02-20] Ivory Coast cocoa arrivals reached 1.30 MMT (Oct 1-Feb 15), a 3% decrease from the previous year (Source: Nasdaq).\n[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis contained a logical flaw by introducing unsupported claims about 'faltering global grinding demand' and 'demand destruction' which were not present in the provided evidence. A revised, strictly evidence-based assessment maintains a bearish outlook driven by projected oversupply. According to Nasdaq, West African pod counts are 7% above the five-year average, directly supporting StoneX's forecast of a substantial 287,000 MT global surplus for the 2025/26 season. Physical market distress is already evident in Ghana, where accumulating unsold warehouse stocks and declining global prices forced a nearly 30% reduction in farmgate prices (Food Business Africa). While Ivory Coast port arrivals are currently lagging slightly by 3% year-over-year (Nasdaq), the overwhelming biological yield indicators and regional warehouse stock accumulations point to a well-supplied market, justifying a bearish stance without needing to assume unverified demand destruction.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

That does not prove the Fed was the dominant driver; cocoa is often driven by idiosyncratic fundamentals (weather, disease, grind demand, West Africa flows) that weren\u2019t examined.\n- Confirmation/selection bias: The evidence set is skewed toward bearish items (monthly down ~30%, inventory up, farmgate cuts) and doesn\u2019t test alternative explanations (e.g., technical liquidation, positioning, demand/grind data, other macro releases) or whether the Fed effect persisted beyond the initial shock.\n- Recency bias: Emphasis on Feb 18\u201320 events may overstate their structural importance versus broader seasonal/supply-cycle dynamics.\n2) Source specificity:\n- The prior analysis did cite specific outlets and figures (DXY 8-day high; inventories 2,065,040 bags; -8% day; +2.66% rebound; ~-30% monthly). That is good.\n- However, it relied on secondary reporting (\u201cpressuring\u201d FX; \u201creacted to\u201d hawkish tone) rather than showing independent linkage (e.g., correlation across a longer window, futures curve/real yields, positioning). So the claims were specific but not fully validated.\n3) Sentiment tag justification:\n- \u201cBEARISH\u201d is broadly consistent with the cited snapshot: a steep monthly drawdown, higher exchange inventories, and origin price cuts (typically reflecting weak market-clearing conditions). \n- But the tag should be tempered because (a) a one-day rebound occurred, (b) causality from Fed minutes is suggestive not definitive, and (c) inventories and policy moves could be lagging indicators rather than forward predictors. A bearish tilt is still reasonable, but confidence should be reduced.\n\nRevised analysis (improved):\nCocoa prices declined sharply over the month (~-30%), with a notable Feb 19 sell-off (~-8%) that contemporaneous reporting linked to a hawkish read of FOMC minutes and rising ICE-monitored inventories (~2.065M bags, a ~5-month high). Mechanically, a hawkish Fed surprise can tighten financial conditions and lift USD (DXY to an ~8-day high), which can be a marginal headwind for USD-priced commodities by raising effective costs for non-USD buyers and encouraging risk-off/position trimming. However, this channel is typically secondary for cocoa versus commodity-specific fundamentals, and the evidence presented is time-coincident and media-attributed rather than a demonstrated dominant causal driver.\n\nOn the cocoa-specific side, rising exchange inventories and reported consideration of farmgate price cuts in Ivory Coast (after Ghana\u2019s ~30% cut) are more directly consistent with weakening near-term pricing power and/or an adjustment to softer market conditions. The modest Feb 20 rebound (+2.66%) suggests volatility and the possibility of short-covering rather than a confirmed trend reversal.\n\nNet assessment: Near-term bias remains bearish given the magnitude of the monthly downtrend and the corroborating stock/origin policy signals, with the Fed/DXY shift best treated as an incremental macro headwind that may amplify moves rather than solely explain them.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Calling it bullish risks confirmation bias (interpreting \u201crisk premium/uncertainty\u201d as bullish without evidence of supply loss).\n- False causation / weak causal chain: It implied policy resets and financing transitions can \u201cslow procurement/marketing decisions\u201d and create \u201cexport availability risk premium,\u201d but the packet contains no direct evidence of procurement delays, delivery failures, port congestion, or reduced exports. That is plausible but unproven from the cited items.\n- Recency framing: The analysis heavily weights the most recent policy headlines to infer near-term flow disruption, without balancing against the explicit CCC confirmation of price stability through Mar 31 (which, at least officially, reduces immediate uncertainty).\n\n2) Source specificity vs vagueness\n- Strength: It did cite concrete dated items and sources (Ecofin, Reuters/CitiNewsroom, MyJoyOnline/Cocoa Intel, Graphic Online, CitiNewsroom).\n- Weakness: Several conclusions were phrased generally (\u201cexecution risk,\u201d \u201ctiming uncertainty,\u201d \u201crisk premium increases\u201d) without tying them to specific observable indicators in the packet (e.g., arrears, warehouse stocks, port throughput, purchasing volumes). Those are interpretive leaps rather than sourced facts.\n\n3) Sentiment tag justification\n- Not justified as BULLISH by the provided evidence alone. A producer-price cut in Ghana and discussion of a potential cut in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire are more consistent with (a) an attempt to realign domestic prices with a weaker global market and/or (b) reduced sector affordability/financing capacity. Both point toward BEARISH or at least NEUTRAL for cocoa prices unless there is separate evidence of supply disruption, smuggling constraints, hoarding, or production shortfalls (none provided here).\n\nRevised analysis (improved, tighter to evidence)\n- The dominant signal in the packet is policy/financing adjustment in two regulated marketing systems (Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire), not broad political instability or confirmed physical/logistics disruption.\n- Ghana has enacted a material policy change: a 28.6% producer-price cut effective immediately (Graphic Online). Separately, Ghana plans to raise GH\u00a230 billion via a domestic syndicated bond to support COCOBOD working capital (CitiNewsroom), indicating funding pressure and an active effort to shore up liquidity.\n- C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire\u2019s CCC has officially maintained the farmgate price at 2,800 CFA/kg through Mar 31, 2026 (MyJoyOnline / Cocoa Intel). However, Reuters/Ecofin report that high-level discussions are underway and \u201call options\u201d are being considered to potentially cut the farmgate price to align with Ghana (Reuters/CitiNewsroom; Ecofin). This creates policy-direction uncertainty beyond the formal CCC statement.\n- What can be concluded from the packet: near-term regulatory/pricing-policy uncertainty is elevated (especially in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) and Ghana is in a financing-rebalancing phase for cocoa operations. What cannot be concluded from the packet: that exports will be disrupted, that procurement will materially slow, or that physical supply will tighten\u2014those require separate operational data.\n- Market implication (within the limits of evidence): administered price cuts (actual in Ghana, contemplated in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire) are consistent with a weaker pricing environment and efforts to realign farmgate economics with global conditions. On evidence provided, the directional bias is more BEARISH/NEUTRAL than bullish; any bullish \u201crisk premium\u201d claim would need corroboration of supply loss or delivery constraints.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

[2026-02-20] Cocoa prices extended a six-week selloff, hitting 2.75-year nearest-futures lows with NY cocoa closing down 8% at the start of the session (Source: Nasdaq / Barchart). 2. [2026-02-18] ICE-monitored cocoa inventories rose to a 5-month high of 2,065,040 bags, reflecting a lack of buying interest (Source: Barchart). 3.

[2026-02-05] ICE London (European) inventories edged lower by 469 bags (Source: CocoaIntel).\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: Several weaknesses are identified. (1) Confirmation bias: The prior analysis selectively weighted bearish signals while immediately dismissing the Rabobank surplus revision downward (from 328,000 MT to 250,000 MT \u2014 a 24% reduction) as merely a 'nuance.' A 78,000 MT reduction in expected surplus is non-trivial and could signal improving supply-demand balance ahead, warranting more than a one-sentence acknowledgment. (2) Recency bias: Heavy weighting was given to the Feb 20 single-session 8% price drop without acknowledging that sharp single-session moves can represent capitulation or overshooting rather than trend confirmation. Treating one dramatic session as directional evidence without noting this risk is analytically incomplete. (3) False causation: The analysis implies inventory builds directly caused the price collapse, but correlation was treated as causation. Prices may have fallen due to speculative positioning unwinds, currency effects, or macro risk-off sentiment \u2014 factors not examined. (4) Vague demand-side claims: The reference to 'falling global grindings and reluctance from international buyers' was attributed to 'raw research' without a specific source citation, violating sourcing standards applied elsewhere. (5) The 0.93 confidence score was unjustifiably precise given the absence of demand-side sourcing, the unexamined surplus revision, and lack of positioning data. REVISED ASSESSMENT: The dominant trend remains bearish \u2014 inventory builds are confirmed across two data points with specific figures, price action is consistent with supply overhang, and the macro surplus backdrop is corroborated by a named institution (Rabobank). However, the Rabobank revision downward introduces a legitimate medium-term counterpoint that could signal a bottoming process. The European inventory drawdown, while small, is directionally opposite to the US trend and should not be entirely dismissed. Confidence is reduced from the prior 0.93 to HIGH (rather than EXTREME) to reflect these unresolved ambiguities. Sentiment remains BEARISH but with acknowledgment that downside momentum may be approaching exhaustion near multi-year lows.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Weak demand signals from 12-year low European grindings and consumer shrinkflation/substitution themes persist. Ghana's aggressive 28.6% farmgate price cut to offload excess supply, despite farmer backlash, underscores oversupply dominance. However, recency of data (all within 2 days) warrants caution against overextrapolation without confirmation of sustained trends or supply disruptions. No bullish counter-evidence present.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Exchange-certified inventories have indeed risen to a five-month high, suggesting adequate near-term supplies for the trade; however, stocks are still well below the 10-year average, so the market is not awash in beans. The possibility that Ivory Coast will cut its farm-gate price confirms pressure on growers\u2019 margins and indicates that origin governments acknowledge lower export revenues, but this move is a response to prices rather than a fresh driver of them. Without current Q4 grind statistics, it is premature to label demand \u2018weak\u2019; confectionery sales could remain resilient, and the 2.66 % bounce on 20 Feb shows that speculative short-covering can appear quickly once technical levels are hit.\n\nFundamentals therefore lean mildly bearish (inventory build, producer price cuts), yet the evidence is insufficient to call for a sustained collapse. A neutral-to-bearish stance is more balanced until new data on grinds, weather in West Africa\u2019s mid-crop, or currency shifts emerge.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

No countervailing bullish factors evident, minimizing recency or confirmation bias risks; price cuts correlate with supply dynamics rather than assuming causation for demand weakness.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
