[2026-02-24] Mondelez reports West African cocoa pod counts are 7% above the five-year average, with favorable immediate harvest conditions.

It also failed to explicitly cite Mondelez and Rabobank. A revised assessment indicates a bearish market environment. Although there are bullish headwinds\u2014specifically C\u00f4te d'Ivoire's 10.8% YoY production drop and Rabobank's downward revision of the global surplus\u2014the net global balance remains in a 250,000 MT surplus. This surplus is physically supported by Mondelez's data showing West African pod counts 7% above the five-year average. The aggressive farmgate price cuts in Ghana and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire confirm that the market is reacting to this overarching surplus and declining global prices, outweighing the localized Ivorian production deficit.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Brazil's import halt may pressure exports, risking port stockpiles without offsetting origin slowdown. No evidence of physical bottlenecks (e.g., congestion), implying smooth flows despite gaps in vessel/dwell metrics.

[2026-02-23] ICE cocoa inventories rose to a 5.5-month high of 2,130,225 bags, driven by buyers retreating from official farm-gate prices in Ivory Coast and Ghana (Source: Nasdaq). 2. [2026-02-25] Cocoa prices fell to 3,067.67 USD/T, continuing a month-long decline of nearly 30% amid sluggish demand and ample supply expectations (Source: Trading Economics). 3. [2026-02-24] ICE London cocoa futures hit a new 2.75-year nearest-futures low, while May NY cocoa posted a contract low during a seven-week downtrend (Source: Nasdaq / Barchart). 4. [2026-02-22] Ghana reported a liquidity crisis with approximately GH\u00a210 billion in unpaid obligations to Licensed Buying Companies, freezing domestic transactions (Source: CocoaIntel). 5. [2026-02-25] Market has transitioned into a contango structure; European warehouse stocks ended 2025 at approximately 36,210 tonnes (broadly flat); Ghana holding 50,000 tonnes of unsold cocoa; European Q4 2025 grindings fell to 304,470 tonnes year-on-year (Source: Raw Research).\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: (1) CONFIRMATION BIAS RISK \u2014 The prior analysis sequentially marshaled every data point toward a bearish conclusion without adequately stress-testing contrary interpretations. For example, Ghana's liquidity crisis was acknowledged as potentially delaying export certification but immediately dismissed without quantifying the supply disruption risk this represents. A paralyzed domestic supply chain in the world's second-largest producer is a meaningful potential bullish catalyst that deserves more than a parenthetical concession. (2) FALSE CAUSATION \u2014 The prior analysis described European Q4 2025 grinding declines as 'structural rather than cyclical demand destruction' \u2014 this is an interpretive overreach. A single quarter of reduced grindings could reflect inventory destocking by manufacturers at elevated prices, seasonal patterns, or post-2025 demand deferral, not necessarily permanent reformulation. Characterizing it as structural without multi-quarter trend confirmation is speculative. (3) RECENCY BIAS \u2014 A 30% one-month price decline is cited as validating the bearish thesis, but sharp price declines at multi-year lows can also signal oversold conditions and mean-reversion setups. The prior analysis did not acknowledge this technical risk. (4) SOURCE QUALITY \u2014 Item 5 is sourced to 'Raw Research' without institutional attribution, making it the weakest evidential pillar despite being heavily weighted in the analysis. (5) CONTANGO INTERPRETATION \u2014 Contango confirms near-term supply adequacy but does not rule out curve flattening or re-inversion on weather, crop disease, or demand recovery surprises in H2 2026. REVISED ASSESSMENT: The weight of evidence remains bearish: rising certified stocks at a 5.5-month high, confirmed contango curve structure, 30% price decline, multi-year futures lows, falling grindings, and Ghana's 50,000-tonne unsold overhang all point in the same direction. However, Ghana's domestic liquidity paralysis introduces a non-trivial near-term supply disruption risk that could temporarily arrest price declines. The bearish thesis is well-supported but not without asymmetric tail risk to the upside if origin supply chains seize. Confidence is modestly reduced from 0.92 to reflect these underweighted risks.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Additional context: Bullish trader positioning theme indicates potential short-covering risk despite bearish fundamentals.\n[ANALYSIS]: Bearish supply/demand dynamics persist: West African producers (Ghana, Ivory Coast) are cutting farmgate prices to offload unsold stocks amid better crop outlooks, boosting supply, while demand lags from prior price-induced destruction and declining grindings. Extreme bearish sentiment and price plunges to multi-year lows reinforce this, but 'bullish trader positioning' suggests crowded shorts and reversal potential if supply cuts fail or protests disrupt output.

(source: Trading Economics); [2026-02-24] The 200-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) for US Cocoa Futures is recorded at 3797.18, with the 200-day EMA at 3796.43.

(source: Barchart)\n[ANALYSIS]: Critique: The original analysis shows mild recency bias by emphasizing the recent 29.45% monthly drop and rising inventories without equally weighing the RSI's recovery from oversold levels, which could indicate short-term exhaustion of downside momentum. No clear logical fallacies like confirmation bias or false causation are present, as supply factors are directly linked to price pressure via cited data. Sources are specific and cited throughout, avoiding vague claims. The bearish sentiment tag is justified by the evidence of price below the 200-day SMA (19% discount), surging inventories, and projected surpluses, which outweigh the neutral RSI signal without bullish confirmations like divergences or demand indicators.\n\nRevised Analysis: The cocoa price at $3,067.67 remains 19% below the 200-day SMA of 3,797.18, underscoring a bearish long-term trend with lower highs and lows fueled by excess supply. The 29.45% monthly decline, combined with ICE inventories at a 5.5-month high of 2,137,148 bags and StoneX's forecasts of 287,000 MT surplus for 2025/26 and 267,000 MT for 2026/27, point to ongoing downward pressure as supply exceeds demand. The RSI at 50.237 (neutral) signals potential short-term stabilization after recovering from oversold territory, but lacks bullish indicators such as moving average crossovers or positive divergence to suggest a reversal. Support near 3,059 could provide temporary relief, yet the supply dynamics favor continued bearishness unless demand catalysts emerge.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(RAW RESEARCH FINDINGS); - The 'CCH7' option volatility skew reflects a market in contango, where the 'permanent shortage premium' has evaporated due to rising inventories and demand destruction. (RAW RESEARCH FINDINGS)\n[ANALYSIS]: The evidence shows a clear shift toward oversupply, evidenced by multi-month high inventories, forecasted global surpluses for 2025/26 and 2026/27, and substantial price declines (29% monthly, 66% YoY), which likely reflect both excess supply and weakened demand. Declining IV from extreme levels and 'cheap' premiums relative to recent history, combined with contango skew indicating evaporated shortage premium, suggest market expectations of lower volatility and sustained supply excess. Critique notes: No major logical fallacies, though correlation (e.g., price drops and demand destruction) should not imply strict causation without further data; sources are specific and cited; bearish sentiment fully justified by uniform evidence direction.
