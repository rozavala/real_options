    "entry_thesis": "The market presents a sharp dislocation between technical price action and physical reality. While the Bear correctly identifies a technical breakdown (price significantly below 200-day SMA) and a surge in export registrations (+35.8%), the Bull's counter-evidence regarding 'exit failure' is empirically stronger: a 65% port delay rate and drawing ICE stocks prove that the 'surging' supply is trapped at origin, not reaching the market. Crucially, the Urgent Trigger (Drought in Minas Gerais during the critical bean-filling stage) introduces a fresh fundamental supply shock that the current liquidation wave ignores. With the ML model indicating the current price (299.95) is trading ~8% below its expected fair value (324.88) and the forward curve remaining in backwardation, the sell-off appears to be an irrational liquidity event rather than a structural repricing. We favor the Bullish thesis based on the new weather catalyst, but downgrade conviction due to the high cost of volatility.",

    "entry_thesis": "The debate highlights a strong bearish sentiment, supported by independent lines of evidence across several reports indicating a significant 4.85% price drop and market reaction prioritizing rain-induced crop improvement over flood risks. The agronomist report confidently attributes the bearish market sentiment to rains bolstering crop prospects, leading to a price decline to 5.5-month lows. While the bull argues for a supply constraint due to port bottlenecks, the evidence of a 35.8% YoY export surge suggests the market is still finding ways to move coffee, challenging the bullish bottleneck thesis. Additionally, the bearish volatility sentiment implies expensive options and a premium-harvesting strategy, reinforcing the bearish stance. Although there is some bullish sentiment due to potential supply constraints from a stronger BRL and inventory drawdowns, the predominant evidence aligns with a bearish outlook given the immediate impact of favorable rainfall and the risk of speculative liquidation. [DA VETO: SCENARIO 1 - Flood Damage Materializes: The CGE flood warnings in S\u00e3o Paulo prove prescient. Within 5 days, severe flooding causes significant crop damage and infrastructure destruction, reversing the 'beneficial rain' narrative. The market realizes the 4.85% drop was an overcorrection, triggering a violent short-covering rally back above 320 cents/lb as supply fears resurface.]",
