Somar Meteorologia reported a prior moisture deficit (53% of historical average) for the week ending Jan 16. Agronomic data confirms the crop is in the 'grain-filling' stage. Arabica futures fell 3.65% on Jan 31.\n[ANALYSIS]: The market's negative price action (-3.65% in futures) validates the interpretation that the forecasted rains are a bearish supply-side development, acting as a vital corrective to the preceding moisture deficit reported by Somar Meteorologia. Since the crop is in the grain-filling stage, adequate moisture is essential for bean density and size; thus, the 'steady' to 'heavy' precipitation is currently viewed as net-positive for yield potential, outweighing theoretical risks of excess saturation. The alleviation of drought concerns removes the risk premium associated with the prior dry spell, justifying the bearish outlook.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Beneficial rains reported in Minas Gerais, a significant area for Arabica coffee production, suggest a potentially ample 2026/27 Brazilian coffee harvest, carrying a bearish implication for prices given the prospect of increased supply. Meanwhile, the recent recovery of Arabica futures and the CFTC report showing speculators holding net long positions indicate that there is a bullish undertone among traders. This suggests that while the market anticipates increased supply, traders still maintain a degree of optimism, possibly driven by other market dynamics not fully captured in the rain forecasts. Therefore, the combination of these factors results in a neutral sentiment overall, despite the short-term bullish sentiment from position adjustments.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.7\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

(source: Xpert.Digital)\n[ANALYSIS]: The resumption of Red Sea transits by major carriers like Maersk suggests an improvement in logistics, potentially reducing the extended transit times that had affected coffee supply chains negatively. However, the fragility of the region implies risk remains. At the Port of Santos, while the volume of vessel arrivals is high, there is no indication of crisis-level congestion, suggesting a temporary easing of bottlenecks. The delay in EUDR implementation provides regulatory relief, reducing immediate compliance costs for exporters. However, projections of rising shipping and logistics costs continue to pose challenges to supply chains. The planned expansion of the Port of Santos' capacity is a positive long-term development for mitigating supply chain disruptions. Overall, these factors indicate that while some immediate pressures may have eased, underlying risks and potential cost increases could continue to impact coffee supply, keeping the sentiment relatively neutral.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: 1. In December 2025, 65% of container ships at the Port of Santos faced delays, with wait times reported up to 82 days (Source: Revista Cultivar / ElloX Digital). 2. These bottlenecks caused 1,475 containers (approx. 486,000 bags) to fail shipment in December alone. 3. Conversely, the Drewry World Container Index dropped 5% to $2,107 on Jan 29, 2026, and the Trading Economics Index fell 9.68% on Feb 2, 2026. 4. Total 2025 exports finished at 40.05 million bags, down 20.8% YoY.\n[ANALYSIS]: Structural export flow is currently paralyzed by severe congestion at the Port of Santos. The reported 65% vessel delay rate and extreme wait times (up to 82 days) massively exceed the operational alert threshold of 5 days dwell, signaling a critical 'exit failure' for the world's largest supplier. While global freight indicators are bearish (rates falling ~5-10%), this liquidity is inaccessible to Brazilian exporters due to physical port gridlock. The inability to ship nearly 500,000 bags in December creates immediate artificial scarcity at destination markets, forcing a bullish premium on spot availability despite softening global shipping costs.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.95\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

GCA Green Coffee stock reports are confirmed unavailable, having ceased publication in 2023.\n[ANALYSIS]: The inventory data triggers a bullish signal under operational rules, as ICE stocks have drawn down by approximately 28,000 bags in the last two weeks of January. This reduction in visible certified inventory implies that consumption or decertification is outpacing new grading. The sustained backwardation in the forward curve reinforces this view, indicating that the market is pricing in immediate supply tightness and discouraging the storage of coffee for future delivery.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

However, the subsequent sharp correction to 332.25 post-cutoff suggests an overbought market, with speculators building positions into resistance leading to liquidation. Commercials covering shorts and better physical liquidity imply easing supply tightness, pointing to a supply/demand balance shifting from perceived scarcity to normalization amid the correction.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

At 295.25 \u00a2/lb the contract sits 15 % under the front-month 200-day SMA and 17 % beneath the continuous-contract 200-day SMA, an objective indication of a prevailing down-trend. Momentum corroborates the weakness: RSI(14)=41.18 is below the 50-neutral line yet comfortably above oversold (<30), signalling sellers still dominate but have not reached exhaustion. From a tactical perspective the market is wedged only 1.2 % above support (291.60 \u00a2) and 2.4 % below resistance (302.45 \u00a2), offering poor risk-reward for fresh longs until prices decisively clear the upper band.\n\nThe pronounced backwardation\u2014near-term futures priced well above KCH27\u2014usually reflects tight spot supply. However, that structure can also arise from financing, storage and quality premia, so it is not incontrovertible proof of future surplus. What is telling is that the deferred contract remains far below long-run averages despite the carry costs already embedded; this suggests traders are reluctant to price a structural deficit for the 2026/27 crop window.\n\nUnless the contract reclaims the 302\u2013305 \u00a2 area and momentum turns up, the technical path of least resistance is lower. Only material bullish shifts in 2026/27 production or demand statistics would override the bearish chart configuration. Taken together, the signal set supports a cautiously bearish outlook.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.64\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

As of February 2, 2026, KCH26 Implied Volatility is approximately 32.13% to 33.66%, which is described as 'historically moderate' and 'relatively cheap to neutral' compared to historical spikes of 50-60%. 2. Coffee futures (KCH26) are trading between 332.25 and 334.00 cents/lb, significantly down from the 52-week high of ~440 cents. 3. Fundamental drivers include steady rain forecasts in Minas Gerais, Brazil, which have alleviated supply concerns and pressured prices downward.\n[ANALYSIS]: The volatility environment is currently classified as LOW_VOL to low-NORMAL, with Implied Volatility (~33%) trading well below historical extremes, making option premiums 'relatively cheap'. This contrasts with high-volatility regimes where selling premium is preferred. Fundamentally, the market is in a Bearish trend due to improved supply prospects from favorable weather in Brazil. Consequently, the strategy mapping for a LOW_VOL regime with a Bearish directional view points to a LONG_PUT. This strategy leverages the lower cost of options to capture downside potential without the capped profit or margin requirements of credit spreads.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
