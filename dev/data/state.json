Market data from Jan 29 shows Arabica futures fell 1.57% as traders viewed these rains as alleviating dryness during the critical 'bean filling' stage.\n[ANALYSIS]: The transition from a significant moisture deficit to 'wet and stormy' conditions is the primary driver of the current bearish sentiment. While the term 'stormy' introduces potential risks (e.g., physical damage or disease), the immediate market reaction\u2014a 1.57% price decline\u2014confirms that traders prioritize the replenishment of soil moisture during the energy-intensive bean filling stage over potential storm risks.

(source: Nasdaq)'\n[ANALYSIS]: The evidence presented provides a comprehensive view of the factors influencing coffee prices, with Arabica futures declining due to a combination of rising inventories and increased exports from Vietnam. The anticipation of a strong Brazilian harvest further supports a bearish sentiment for Arabica. However, the rise in Robusta futures, driven by weather concerns, could indicate market segmentation where different factors impact Arabica and Robusta differently. It is essential to avoid overgeneralizing the bearish sentiment from Arabica to the entire coffee market without considering these dynamics separately. Recognizing the distinctions between these coffee types would provide a clearer view of market sentiments.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.75\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(source: Kuehne+Nagel / Everstream Analytics), [2026-01-19] Container ship calls at Port of Santos increased to 45 units, up from 40 the previous week. (source: CEIC Data)\n[ANALYSIS]: The data indicates that while Red Sea diversions might be ending, leading to potential future improvements, the transition back to normal routes could create short-term congestion, particularly in European ports. This requires close monitoring as it may impact shipping schedules and costs temporarily. At the Port of Santos, congestion persists, with steady wait times of 1.5 to 2 days and high yard utilization. These factors suggest ongoing challenges in coffee shipment logistics from Brazil. While EUDR compliance has been delayed, offering some regulatory relief, it does not directly address these logistical issues.

Port data confirms 55% of vessels at Brazilian ports faced schedule changes or delays in December. 3. Conversely, the Drewry World Container Index dropped 5% to $2,107 on Jan 29, 2026, signaling loosening global freight markets. 4. Brazilian exporters reported R$ 66.1 million in logistics-related losses for 2025.\n[ANALYSIS]: Structural export flow is currently defined by a critical decoupling between global logistics and local Brazilian infrastructure. While global shipping capacity is easing (Drewry -5%), Brazil's Port of Santos is experiencing a 'hard ceiling' on throughput, evidenced by the inability to ship 602,000 bags in December despite significantly lower overall export volumes (-18.4%). This 55% vessel delay rate indicates that the bottleneck is physical and structural at the origin, not a lack of global containers. This creates a bullish basis scenario: coffee is physically trapped at the port, creating artificial scarcity at destination markets even as global freight rates decline.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.95\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

StoneX reported on Jan 29 that the first lots of replacement certified stocks are beginning to arrive at destination. 4. GCA Green Coffee stocks reports remain unavailable.\n[ANALYSIS]: The quantitative data indicates a 'drawing down' signal, as certified stocks have fallen by approximately 21,500 bags from their mid-January peak. This decline, paired with the strong backwardation (16.80 premium) in the March/May spread, suggests immediate supply tightness where demand for prompt delivery exceeds the incentive to store. While the arrival of replacement stocks noted by StoneX may eventually stabilize inventory, the current market structure and inventory erosion support a bullish outlook under operational rules.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

Commercial covering of shorts at the 200-day moving average support implies underlying demand strength and value perception during the price retreat, pointing to balanced supply/demand dynamics rather than overbought speculation.

If KCZ6 has traded at a sizeable discount to front-month levels all season, a 35-\u00a2 gap vs. KCH6\u2019s 200-day average may overstate weakness. A better gauge would be KCZ6\u2019s own moving averages, which sit nearer 318-320 \u00a2/lb (50-day) and 332-335 \u00a2/lb (200-day) according to Bloomberg data. On that basis KCZ6 is still below its major averages, but the distance is far smaller than first implied.\n\nMomentum is soft\u2014RSI at 42.6 shows sellers in control\u2014yet not oversold. The deeply oversold front-month could signal exhaustion of bearish pressure rather than \u201cscope for more downside.\u201d Inter-month spreads tightening while the spot leg is oversold often precedes short-covering rallies.\n\nTechnically, the 308.57\u2013302.57 \u00a2/lb cluster remains the near-term floor; a daily close under 302.57 would open 300/297. Downside volume has been fading, so a failure to break 308 followed by a push through 314.57 could trigger stops toward 320.57/326.00, where the 50-day EMA intersects.\n\nNet: Trend bias is still lower while price sits beneath its own 50- and 200-day averages, but oversold conditions up front and waning volume temper conviction. Positioning is therefore cautiously bearish, not outright.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.55\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
