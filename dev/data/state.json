Somar Meteorologia reports rainfall at 117% of the historical average, and Canal do Tempo forecasts further accumulations of 150-250 mm. The market has priced this as a supply-positive event, evidenced by the 4.85% drop in futures, as the moisture aids bean sizing and density rather than posing an immediate quality threat.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.95\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(source: The Rio Times), [2026-02-03] Brazil's Central Bank minutes signaled that an interest rate cutting cycle could begin in March, though the Selic rate was kept at 15.00% in the January meeting. (source: Reuters / Investing.com), [2026-02-02] The Central Bank's Focus Bulletin lowered the 2026 inflation forecast to 3.99% and projected the USD/BRL exchange rate to end the year at 5.50. (source: Banco Central do Brasil / InfoMoney)\n[ANALYSIS]: The Brazilian Real's current strength near a nine-month high suggests that the currency is less favorable for exporter revenues, as a stronger Real reduces the local currency earnings from dollar-denominated coffee exports. The high Selic rate at 15.00% supports this currency strength, making it likely that farmer selling is discouraged due to reduced profitability. While the Central Bank signals a potential rate cut in March, expected depreciation of the Real later in the year is not currently sufficient to alter the disincentive for immediate farmer sales. Overall, this scenario indicates potential constraints on immediate coffee supply as farmers wait for more favorable conditions, supportive of coffee prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.85\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

(source: EY)']\n[ANALYSIS]: The provided data indicates ongoing logistical challenges impacting the Coffee Arabica supply chain. The Red Sea disruptions continue to affect shipping routes significantly, with ships opting for longer routes, which increases transit times and costs. This is compounded by increased geopolitical tensions, which are expected to lead to price rises in shipping and logistics throughout 2026. The reduced green coffee exports from Brazil, down 18.4% in December 2025, indicate a strain on supply. The delay in EUDR implementation offers temporary relief from regulatory pressure, but does not ameliorate the existing logistical and production challenges. Overall, the combination of increased costs, continued logistical delays, and reduced export volumes suggests a bearish outlook on the supply side, likely leading to tighter markets and potential price increases.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.3\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

While the Port of Santos remains congested with 55% vessel delays and carriers are managing capacity via 63 blank sailings for February, the physical volume of coffee leaving Brazil has surged (3.7 million bags in Jan, +35.8% YoY). This data confirms that logistical friction is increasing costs for exporters but is no longer effectively trapping supply at origin. The release of this inventory into the market, alongside falling freight rates (-5%), alleviates the artificial scarcity thesis, supporting a bearish outlook for prices as destination stocks replenish.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

This reduction in visible inventory implies that immediate consumption is outpacing new certifications. The bullish sentiment is strongly reinforced by the forward curve structure; the significant premium of March futures over May (~16.20 cents/lb) indicates persistent backwardation. This structure signals acute near-term supply tightness, discouraging storage and incentivizing the immediate release of coffee into the market.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.95\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

However, technical indicators like RSI at 36.00 and Stochastic %K at 12.26% point to oversold conditions rather than overbought, implying the market has corrected from prior highs and is not vulnerable to immediate liquidation from overcrowding, with supply/demand balance appearing more normalized amid recent price weakness.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

[2026-02-02] Active-contract (KCH26) 200-day SMA = 347.03 \u00a2/lb (Barchart).\n[ANALYSIS]: Prior analysis compared KCH27 to the KCH26 200-day SMA and treated the 52 \u00a2/lb discount as evidence of bearish fundamentals. That is a weak inference: term-structure differences can stem from storage costs, interest rates, and differential quality rather than outright supply-demand expectations, so the conclusion risks false causation. Using a moving average from a different contract can also be misleading because each delivery month has its own price history.\n\nTechnically, the evidence still paints a mildly negative picture. KCH27 trades just above first support (291.60) with an RSI of 34\u2014approaching oversold but not yet divergent. The short-term 20/50-day bullish crossover argues for a potential bounce, yet the broader \u2018Sell\u2019 composite and sub-neutral momentum caution against assuming a trend reversal. Volume and open-interest data\u2014absent here\u2014would be needed to confirm commitment at these levels.\n\nFundamentally, no direct data on certified stocks, Brazilian weather or currency moves were cited, so attributing the price structure to \u2018looser fundamentals later this year\u2019 was speculative. Without corroborating supply-demand statistics, the outlook should rely mainly on the chart set-up.\n\nNetting these factors: price is weak within its immediate range, but oversold conditions and a fresh short-term MA crossover temper the bearish view. The most defensible stance is a cautious, slightly bearish bias pending a break of 291.60 or a close back above 302.45.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.48\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
