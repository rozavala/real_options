Agronomic data confirms the crop is in the 'bean-filling' stage. Conab forecasts a record 2026 Brazil coffee crop of 66.2 million bags, with Arabica production up 23.2%. 10-day forecasts predict continued passing showers and temperatures between 62-85\u00b0F.\n[ANALYSIS]: The convergence of Somar's meteorological data showing above-average rainfall (113%) and Conab's record production forecast creates a robust bearish signal. Agronomically, moisture during the 'bean-filling' stage is crucial for maximizing yield weight, validating the projected 23.2% increase in Arabica output. The absence of weather stress (drought or excessive heat) removes supply-side risk premiums, solidifying expectations for a surplus that will likely depress prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Central Bank's Focus Bulletin projects year-end Selic rate at 12.25% and inflation at 3.97%. Markets expect a Selic rate cut for the March meeting.\n[ANALYSIS]: The USD/BRL exchange rate's strength signals that the BRL will return less value from USD-denominated commodity sales, leading to slower selling by Brazilian farmers. This pattern is noted in soybean sales and could extend to other commodities like coffee. The high Selic rate maintains BRL strength but potential future cuts could impact selling behavior. Currently, constrained supply from Brazil might support higher coffee prices, although the direct effect on coffee due to soybean sales requires cautious interpretation to avoid false causation.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

It mentions Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd's resumption of Red Sea transits, but this seems to have minimal direct impact on the Brazilian situation, possibly overstating its relevance here. The delay in the EUDR implementation is correctly noted as regulatory relief but perhaps overly suggests it bears little impact on immediate logistics. Overall, the potential for coffee supply disruptions due to the strikes is a valid concern and could lead to market volatility. There is no apparent logical fallacy, but the impact of the resumed Red Sea transits should not be construed as significant within this Brazilian context.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

While the 7% decline in the Drewry Index suggests global freight constraints are easing, the 55% vessel delay rate at Santos isolates the bottleneck specifically to Brazilian infrastructure. Crucially, the 45.6% plunge in Robusta exports indicates that domestic industry is aggressively securing supply to substitute for Arabica, effectively removing this volume from the global balance sheet. This creates a structural deficit for international buyers that lower freight rates cannot resolve.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

        "data": "[EVIDENCE]: As of Feb 10, 2026, ICE Coffee C certified stocks stood at 426,321 bags, a decrease from 428,064 bags reported on the previous day. On Feb 9, 2026, the forward curve remained in 'clear backwardation,' with the March 2026 contract settling at 299.20 cents/lb, a premium over the May 2026 contract at 293.10 cents/lb. Arabica futures prices recovered to 297.39 US cents/lb on Feb 12, 2026, following the recent inventory draw and curve structure signals.\n[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis correctly identified the bullish trend but introduced external information regarding Conab forecasts that was not present in the provided evidence. A stricter interpretation relies solely on the interplay between market structure and inventory. The 'clear backwardation' (March trading at a 6.10 cent premium over May) is the strongest indicator of immediate supply stress, as it financially penalizes holding inventory. This structural signal is directly validated by the physical drawdown of 1,743 bags reported on Feb 10. The subsequent price recovery on Feb 12 confirms that the market is reacting efficiently to these scarcity signals. Therefore, the bullish outlook is robustly supported by the convergence of falling stocks and an inverted forward curve.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

Arabica fell 1.87% to 294.2 US cents/lb on 2026-02-11 amid Vietnam's 38.3% YoY January export surge (bearish pressure) (source: USDA FAS report, 2026-02-12). 4.

These are offset by bullish near-term factors, including Colombia's sharp production decline (supply tightness) and the 2026-02-12 rebound driven by currency effects and short-covering, supporting 'rising Arabica prices' mentions. No logical fallacies evident\u2014analysis avoids overemphasizing recent rebound (recency) by balancing with longer-term forecasts, and causation is tied directly to reported drivers without unsubstantiated links.

Logical fallacies \u2013 The original note assumed that because price is below the 200-day SMA, the long-term trend is down. That inference is incomplete: we did not check the slope of the moving average; price can trade below a rising SMA during a corrective phase. We also treated an oversold RSI (29.5) as evidence of continuing weakness, ignoring the possibility of a momentum reversal. This is a form of confirmation bias. The mention of \"improved Brazilian crop prospects\" introduced an un-sourced causal claim (potential false causation) and recency bias because it was not part of the documented evidence.\n2. Source quality \u2013 All market-generated data points were properly cited, but the fundamental claim about Brazilian supply had no citation.\n3. Sentiment tag \u2013 Bearish bias was defensible given price action, but the analysis discounted oversold and divergence signals that often precede counter-trend rallies. A more balanced stance (moderately bearish or even neutral) would be more consistent with the mixed evidence.\n\nRevised view:\n\u2022 Price is 58 \u00a2/lb below the quoted 200-day SMA. Without the slope of that SMA we can only say price is trading under long-term average value, a traditionally bearish\u2014but not decisive\u2014condition.\n\u2022 Daily RSI at 29.5 places the market in oversold territory; this can either signal continued weakness in a strong down-trend or the proximity of a short-covering bounce. Weekly RSI divergence adds a warning that downside momentum may be tiring.\n\u2022 First support rests at 272.07 and 267.33 \u00a2. A decisive close under 267 \u00a2 would confirm a continuation of lower lows; conversely, a rebound above 282.13 \u00a2 would open a test of the 290-300 \u00a2 congestion zone (not yet visible but derived from January price action).\n\u2022 Because technical conditions are stretched while the contract remains beneath key averages, the near-term outlook is cautiously bearish: downside risk persists, but risk-to-reward for initiating fresh shorts here is less attractive than it was above 300 \u00a2.\n\u2022 No fundamental conclusions are drawn due to lack of verifiable supply-demand data in the evidence set.\n\nTrading implication: Existing shorts could trail stops just above 282 \u00a2 to protect gains. New positions may wait for either a breakdown through 267 \u00a2 (momentum entry) or a corrective rally toward the falling 50-day EMA (not provided) to improve risk-reward.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Brazil's 2026 coffee production is forecast to reach a record 66.2 million bags (+17.2%), driving futures to 6-month lows around 298.40 cents/lb [Source: Conab / Barchart]. Raw Research classifies front-month premiums as 'expensive' relative to historical norms, noting a steep volatility term structure and put-skew driven by bearish pressure [Source: Raw Research].\n[ANALYSIS]: The volatility environment is confirmed as HIGH_VOL, characterized by a steep inversion where front-month IV (~52%) vastly exceeds back-month levels (~30%). This pricing anomaly, combined with the fundamental catalyst of a record Brazilian crop (66.2M bags), creates a high-probability setup for selling strategies. The critique of the prior analysis highlights the need to account for gamma risk given the proximity to the March expiration (Feb 12); however, the 'expensive' premium designation validates the short-volatility approach.
