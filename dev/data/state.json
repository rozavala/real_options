However, forecasts as of Jan 29 predict up to 162 mm of accumulation with mild temperatures (18\u00b0C-23\u00b0C) through Feb 1. Agronomist Jonas Ferraresso (Jan 26) confirms Arabica plants are in the 'bean filling' stage and appear 'vibrant', indicating effective moisture uptake.\n[ANALYSIS]: The meteorological data indicates a rapid correction of the mid-January moisture deficit, which is fundamentally supply-positive. While 162 mm is significant, the agronomic context (bean filling stage following dryness) renders this rainfall highly beneficial for bean sizing and density rather than damaging. The specific report of 'vibrant' plant health confirms the crop is physiologically capable of utilizing this input. Improved yield prospects in Brazil's key growing region reduce production risk, supporting a negative price outlook.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(source: RFD-TV)\n[ANALYSIS]: The data indicates a strengthening BRL, shown by a 5.64% appreciation against the USD over the past month. This currency strengthening typically discourages farmer selling, as the local currency earnings from exports become less favorable. Additionally, with the Central Bank signaling upcoming rate cuts starting in March, this could further strengthen the BRL or at least limit depreciation in the short term. As farmers anticipate potentially better exchange rates, they might delay selling, possibly leading to short-term constraints on supply. This scenario would support coffee prices as supply becomes slightly more restricted.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.85\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

Brazilian exports are heavily impacted by port congestion, resulting in substantial shipment delays and financial losses. Moreover, around 55% of vessels faced disruptions, leaving large volumes of coffee unshipped. In the Red Sea, while there have been efforts to stabilize shipping routes, with Maersk returning some services to the Suez Canal, other carriers like CMA CGM are still avoiding the route due to security concerns, preferring the longer Cape of Good Hope. This mixed situation implies continued volatility in coffee supply routes, with potential for increased costs and delays in reaching global markets, which could drive up prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.85\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

The inability to ship ~672k bags in January indicates that port infrastructure at Santos remains the primary choke point, decoupling Brazilian supply from global logistics improvements. Furthermore, the sharp increase in blank sailings for February (63) threatens to reduce available vessel slots just as exporters need to clear the January backlog. This creates a bullish basis environment: the coffee is physically stuck at origin due to local friction and reduced vessel calls, creating artificial scarcity at destination markets despite the theoretical availability of global containers.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.95\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

GCA Green Coffee stock reports remain unavailable, with no official data published since 2023.\n[ANALYSIS]: The continued drawdown in ICE Arabica Certified Stocks triggers a bullish signal under operational rules, indicating that certified inventory is being removed to satisfy immediate demand rather than accumulating. This physical tightness is corroborated by the backwardation structure in the forward curve, where the premium for March delivery over May incentivizes prompt shipment over storage.

Oversold technical indicators (RSI 31.23, Stochastic 14.42) and a sharp price decline (-4.42% on Jan 28) driven by long liquidation suggest aggressive selling pressure, while rising inventories to 461,829 bags point to improving supply availability.

Price is 6 % beneath its own 50-day SMA and almost 7 % under the 200-day SMA, confirming a medium-term down-trend. Momentum has improved slightly (RSI 34.7 vs. prior 31) but remains weak; no bullish divergence has formed. The large speculative net-short suggests shorts are already crowded, which could fuel a short-covering bounce, yet it also confirms prevailing bearish sentiment. Failure to reclaim the 20-day EMA (~323 \u00a2/lb) would keep pressure on the November low at 309.80 \u00a2/lb; a break there exposes the psychological 300 \u00a2/lb level. Conversely, a close back above 327-330 \u00a2/lb would neutralise the down-trend and target the 338-340 \u00a2/lb 200-day SMA. Given the trend-following signals and only modestly oversold momentum, risk remains skewed lower, though positioning argues against chasing fresh shorts at current levels.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.63\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
