[today] 10-day forecasts show consistent rain through early March with daily probabilities between 55% and 96% and temperatures of 19\u00b0C to 29\u00b0C (AccuWeather). [2026-02-12] NOAA/CPC confirmed a 60% probability of transition from La Ni\u00f1a to ENSO-neutral conditions, with a patchy wet bias persisting across East Brazil. [2026-02-06] Conab projects a record 2026 harvest of 66.2 million bags due to improved rainfall during key development stages.\n[ANALYSIS]: A critique of the previous analysis reveals a slight confirmation bias: it assumed the above-average rainfall was exclusively beneficial without acknowledging the potential risks of continuous, heavy precipitation, such as fungal diseases (e.g., coffee leaf rust) or future logistical delays. However, the sources cited (Somar Meteorologia, Conab, NOAA, AccuWeather) are highly specific and authoritative. The Arabica crop is currently in the bean-filling stage, where the 138% of average rainfall reported by Somar Meteorologia is highly advantageous for bean sizing. Conab's projection of a record 66.2 million bag harvest confirms the fundamental oversupply narrative. The elimination of the weather risk premium, driven by the ENSO-neutral transition and consistent rain forecasts, justifies the 15-month price lows observed on Nasdaq/Barchart. The sentiment remains firmly bearish due to overwhelming supply indicators, though extreme confidence should be tempered to 'HIGH' to account for inherent agricultural volatility and potential disease risks from excessive moisture.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(Trading Economics)\n- [2026-01-28] Copom maintained Selic at 15.00% for the fifth consecutive meeting. (FocusEconomics)\n- [2026-02-18] Focus Bulletin: market expectation for Selic to drop to 12.25% by end-2026. (Banco Central do Brasil)\n- [2026-02-10] 2025/26 soybean farmer sales lagging (~33.9% to 38%), ~10pp below historical averages; strong BRL cited as a driver. (Ukragroconsult / Agrolatam)\n[ANALYSIS]: Critique of the prior analysis\n1) Logical fallacies / reasoning risks\n- Potential false causation / overgeneralization: It used soybean selling behavior as direct evidence for coffee selling behavior. While both are USD-linked export crops and the mechanism is plausible, the packet does not provide coffee-specific data showing that Brazilian coffee producers are currently withholding sales due to BRL strength.\n- Confirmation bias: The argument leaned heavily on the one data point that supports \u201cstrong BRL slows selling\u201d (soy), and did not weigh other determinants of coffee producer selling (crop cycle, inventory needs, basis, different hedging practices, export program commitments) because they were not in the packet. This makes the conclusion directionally plausible but not fully established.\n- Recency bias: It relied on a very recent BRL snapshot (month-to-date move; \u201cstrongest since May 2024\u201d) and inferred near-term supply behavior without showing persistence or thresholds (e.g., what USD/BRL level meaningfully changes coffee selling).\n- Time-horizon mismatch: It mentioned end-2026 Selic expectations as a potential later offset, but did not clarify that this is a long-dated expectation and may not affect immediate BRL levels or coffee flows unless expectations shift nearer-term.\n\n2) Specific sourcing vs vague claims\n- Strength: It cited specific dates and sources for USD/BRL levels and the Selic-rate backdrop (Trading Economics; FocusEconomics; BCB Focus Bulletin) and for the soybean selling lag (Ukragroconsult/Agrolatam).\n- Weakness: It made an extrapolative claim (\u201cnear-term implication for Arabica is reduced producer selling\u2026 supportive for USD Arabica prices\u201d) without a coffee-specific cited source in the packet. That part is an inference, not directly evidenced.\n\n3) Is the sentiment tag justified?\n- Partially justified but overstated: The evidence supports a macro linkage (strong BRL can discourage producer selling) and shows that effect in soy. However, tagging Arabica as BULLISH implies a commodity-specific price impact that is not directly evidenced in the packet (no coffee export pace, coffee farmer sales, or coffee price response included). Given the limited, indirect evidence, a NEUTRAL-to-mildly-BULLISH stance would be more defensible.\n\nRevised analysis (improved)\n- The packet shows BRL appreciation (USD/BRL down to ~5.1724; strongest since May 2024), and attributes that strength to Brazil\u2019s still-restrictive policy stance (Selic 15%) and high real-yield spreads (Trading Economics; FocusEconomics). A stronger BRL mechanically reduces BRL receipts per USD of exports, which can weaken the incentive to sell/hedge at prevailing USD prices.\n- The only direct behavioral evidence provided is cross-commodity: Brazilian soybean farmer sales are running ~10pp below historical averages, with the strong BRL explicitly cited as a factor (Ukragroconsult/Agrolatam). This supports the general mechanism that BRL strength can slow producer selling, but it does not prove the same magnitude/timing for coffee.\n- Forward-looking policy expectations (BCB Focus Bulletin projecting Selic at 12.25% by end-2026) indicate potential easing later, which could reduce BRL support over time. However, this is expectation-based and long-dated; the packet does not show that it is currently translating into BRL weakening.\n- Net implication for Arabica from the evidence strictly provided: BRL strength is a *mild supportive* macro factor for USD-denominated coffee prices via potentially reduced Brazilian selling pressure, but confidence is limited because the packet lacks coffee-specific supply/flow confirmation. Therefore, sentiment should be NEUTRAL with a bullish skew rather than outright bullish.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

(S&P Global / IndustryIDX)\n2) [2026-02-23] Hapag-Lloyd reported a 15-hour vessel wait time at DP World Santos with yard utilization at 64%, and 18 hours waiting at Santos Brasil due to high channel traffic. (Hapag-Lloyd Operational Update)\n3) [2026-01-27] Cecaf\u00e9 reported 55% of coffee export vessels faced delays or schedule changes, adding R$66.1 million in logistics costs due to \u201cexhausted\u201d port infrastructure. (DatamarNews / Cecaf\u00e9)\n4) [2026-02-08] European green coffee stocks were 458,801 tons (late 2025), significantly below ~700,000-ton levels seen in 2022, implying thinner buffers against logistics shocks. (European Coffee Federation / CIC)\n5) [2025-12-23] Regulation (EU) 2025/2650 published, confirming the one-year delay of EUDR implementation to Dec 30, 2026 for large operators. (Official Journal of the European Union)\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE (of the prior write-up)\n1) Potential logical fallacies / reasoning gaps\n- Confirmation bias: The packet is interpreted almost entirely through a \u201ctightness\u201d lens; it doesn\u2019t test offsetting explanations (e.g., congestion that is manageable, rerouting already priced-in, or demand weakness absorbing delays).\n- Recency bias: Several items are very recent operational snapshots (e.g., a single carrier\u2019s waits at Santos on one date). Treating these as persistent/market-wide can overstate the signal.\n- False causation / overreach: Moving from \u201cdelays exist\u201d to \u201cArabica is supply-supportive/bullish\u201d assumes delays materially reduce deliverable availability versus merely shifting timing, and assumes price impact rather than just higher logistics costs/margins.\n- Base-rate neglect: A 15\u201318 hour wait can be meaningful operationally, but without historical comparison (typical waits) or throughput data, it\u2019s hard to infer severity.\n- Overgeneralization: Santos is important, but Arabica flows are multi-origin (e.g., Colombia, Central America, Ethiopia) and multi-destination; the analysis implicitly extrapolates Brazil/Santos conditions to the whole market.\n\n2) Source specificity vs vague claims\n- Strength: The prior analysis did cite specific sources and quantitative details (6\u20137% lead time increase; 15\u201318 hour waits; 55% vessels affected; R$66.1m; 458,801t stocks; EU regulation date).\n- Weakness: It added interpretive claims not directly evidenced (e.g., \u201cstructural rather than episodic,\u201d \u201crecurring congestion/rollover risk,\u201d and a direct mapping to \u201cdeliverable availability\u201d). Those may be plausible but were not explicitly supported with duration/trend data or futures deliverability mechanics.\n\n3) Is the bullish sentiment tag justified?\n- Partially, but not cleanly. The evidence supports \u201clogistics friction risk\u201d and \u201clower buffer stocks,\u201d which can be supportive if demand is steady and disruptions are not fully priced.\n- However, the packet does not quantify the magnitude of supply displacement, does not show confirmed shortfalls in arrivals/roaster coverage, and does not link delays to certified stock/deliverable constraints. Given those gaps, an unqualified BULLISH tag is too strong; NEUTRAL-to-BULLISH risk skew is more defensible.\n\nREVISED ANALYSIS (improved)\nThe packet credibly indicates elevated logistics friction for coffee flows into 2026, but it is stronger evidence of timing/cost volatility than of outright physical shortage.\n\n- Ocean routing (Red Sea/Cape): If carriers have embedded Cape detours into 2026 baselines with lead times up 6\u20137% (S&P Global / IndustryIDX), then longer transit times may persist. This increases inventory-in-transit and working capital needs and can widen differentials/nearby tightness during disruptions. However, because these detours are now \u201cbaseline,\u201d some of the impact may already be operationally normalized and partially priced.\n\n- Brazil export execution risk (Santos): Hapag-Lloyd\u2019s reported 15\u201318 hour waits at Santos terminals due to channel traffic, alongside 64% yard utilization (Hapag-Lloyd), suggests congestion is present but not, on this data alone, definitively at crisis levels. Cecaf\u00e9\u2019s broader statistic\u201455% of coffee export vessels experiencing delays/schedule changes and R$66.1m additional logistics costs linked to \u201cexhausted\u201d infrastructure (DatamarNews / Cecaf\u00e9)\u2014adds weight that delays are not isolated. Still, the packet lacks time-series context (weeks/months) and volume impact (containers rolled, TEU shortfalls), which are needed to translate congestion into net export reduction rather than shipment deferral.\n\n- Demand-side buffer sensitivity (Europe stocks): European green coffee stocks at 458,801 tons versus ~700,000 tons in 2022 (ECF / CIC) indicates thinner buffers. That raises sensitivity: even \u201cmere\u201d scheduling slippage can more quickly tighten spot availability and prompt higher nearby premiums. Yet stocks alone do not prove insufficiency; consumption rates and replenishment pace are not provided.\n\n- Regulation (EUDR): The confirmed delay to Dec 30, 2026 for large operators (EU 2025/2650) reduces the probability of an immediate compliance-driven disruption in 2026, so it should not be counted as an incremental near-term bullish driver.\n\nNet: The evidence supports a higher probability of logistics-driven volatility (late arrivals, higher landed costs, episodic tightness) rather than a proven, sustained reduction in global Arabica supply. Price implications are therefore best framed as a risk skew toward supportive nearby structure/differentials during disruptions, not a high-conviction outright bullish call absent corroboration (arrival data, certified stocks, export volumes, or demand strength).\n\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

[2026-02-23] Pending stocks awaiting grading surged +18,663 bags to 163,685 bags total \u2014 the largest pending queue observed in the current data series (Source: StoneX). 3.

[2026-01] ICO Composite Indicator at 296.899 cents/lb, down 2.6% MoM (Source: ICO).\n[ANALYSIS]: SELF-CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: (1) Confirmation bias risk: The prior analysis systematically downplayed or reframed every BULLISH signal \u2014 backwardation was dismissed as 'logistical friction,' and the certified stock draw was labeled 'critically misleading in isolation.' While there are legitimate reasons to discount these signals, the rhetorical framing shows a pattern of rationalizing away contrary evidence rather than weighting it neutrally. This is a confirmation bias risk. (2) False causation / recency bias on pending-to-certified conversion: The claim that the 163,685-bag pending queue will 'consistently convert' into certified stock builds cites one prior instance (Feb 18, 14,935 bags). One data point does not establish a reliable pattern. Grading rejection rates, quality thresholds, and logistical delays could delay or reduce conversion. The prior analysis overstated the predictive certainty of this mechanism. (3) Source specificity: Sources are named (StoneX, CocoaIntel, Barchart, Conab, ICO) which is adequate, though exact report URLs or publication titles are not provided \u2014 acceptable given data constraints. (4) Backwardation dismissal: Backwardation is a real and operationally significant BULLISH signal per market structure rules. Categorizing it as 'insufficient and structurally weakening' without direct evidence of the spread narrowing is an assertion rather than a demonstrated fact. The analysis should have noted the spread magnitude to substantiate the claim. (5) Crop projection timing: Conab's Feb 5 forecast is a forward projection, not confirmed production. Weather events, disease, or logistical disruptions between now and harvest could materially alter the outcome. Treating it as a 'dominant structural BEARISH force' assigns excessive certainty to a forecast. REVISED ASSESSMENT: The BEARISH case remains well-supported by converging signals: the record-large pending grading queue (163,685 bags) creates strong probabilistic \u2014 not certain \u2014 forward supply pressure on certified stocks; prices at multi-month lows (277\u2013280 cents/lb) confirm market direction; and the Conab record crop projection, while a forecast, is corroborated by Vietnam Robusta strength and ICO declining composite readings. However, intellectual honesty requires acknowledging: backwardation is a genuine BULLISH structural signal that cannot simply be dismissed; the pending-to-certified conversion is probabilistic, not guaranteed; and the crop forecast carries production risk. The net balance of evidence still favors BEARISH, but with appropriate humility about the counterweights. Confidence is revised to MODERATE (not moderate-to-good) given the one-instance recency bias in the conversion argument and the unquantified backwardation spread.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

However, 'deeply oversold' conditions at multi-month lows suggest potential speculative capitulation and short-covering, indicating seller exhaustion for a short-term rebound.

The confirmed double-top at 434 \u00a2 provides a measured-move target near 255 \u00a2, which aligns with the 61.8 % retracement of the 2023-2025 bull run. Immediate support at 275.9 \u00a2 is fragile; a decisive daily close below would likely trigger stop-loss orders toward 265 \u00a2 and possibly 255 \u00a2.\n\nFundamentally, the expected 17 % YoY jump in Brazil\u2019s 2026/27 harvest adds credible supply pressure. However, two counterpoints temper an outright bearish conviction: (1) ICE certified stocks, although rising marginally, remain historically tight, which limits spot availability; (2) managed-money length is already significantly reduced, so fresh speculative selling power may be smaller than during previous legs down. In addition, the daily RSI sits just above 30, implying near-term oversold risk and the potential for technical bounces toward the 290-300 \u00a2 congestion zone.\n\nNetting these factors, the prevailing bias stays negative as long as prices hold below the 200-day SMA and 300 \u00a2 resistance. Yet, the combination of oversold momentum and low certified stocks argues for a staggered, rather than one-way, decline. Traders may look for rallies into the 290-305 \u00a2 band to re-establish shorts, while keeping an eye on Brazilian weather during flowering, which could quickly reverse sentiment.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
