[2026-02-22] Satellite data reveals 'copious heavy rain' developing across Brazil, confirming excessive amounts forecast by the 12Z GFS model. [2026-02-20] Conab predicts a record 2026 harvest of 66.2 million bags, aided by 'ample rainfall' in Minas Gerais, driving prices to multi-month lows. [RAW RESEARCH] The primary flowering stage occurred in late 2025; current moisture is maintaining a 'very good outlook' for fruit set and development rather than causing damage.\n[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis accurately captured the bearish market direction but slightly glossed over the potential localized risks of 'excessive' rainfall, risking confirmation bias toward a flawless crop. However, synthesizing the specific sources confirms the bearish outlook remains fundamentally robust. Conab's official projection of a record 66.2 million bag harvest provides a strong quantitative anchor. Agronomically, Arabica in Minas Gerais is in the fruit development stage, as flowering concluded in late 2025. Raw research explicitly notes the recent 'copious heavy rain' (confirmed by satellite and the 12Z GFS model) is supporting cherry maturation rather than causing widespread damage. Furthermore, World Weather Inc.'s forecast of upcoming drier conditions in Sul de Minas is a critical detail, as it mitigates the risk of soil over-saturation or fungal diseases that prolonged excessive rain could trigger. This optimal sequence of deep moisture followed by drying cements the record yield expectations, eliminating supply risk premiums and maintaining strong downward pressure on prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Source: ADM Investor Services (contextual FX reference).\n[ANALYSIS]: Critique of prior analysis\n1) Logical fallacies / reasoning risks\n\u2022 Risk of false causation / weak transfer: The analysis infers Arabica producer behavior from soybean commercialization behavior. While both are Brazilian USD-priced exports, crop economics, marketing calendars, on-farm storage, and hedging practices differ. Using soy behavior as \u201creinforcement\u201d for coffee is suggestive, not proof.\n\u2022 Overreach from FX to price (single-factor): \u201cBRL strength \u2192 less selling \u2192 bullish Arabica\u201d is directionally plausible, but it omits other dominant drivers (weather, yields, certified stocks, global demand, ICE structure, Brazilian differentials). With only FX + soy-selling evidence, the commodity-price conclusion should be framed as a marginal input, not a directional call.\n\u2022 Recency / short-window inference: The USD/BRL move is described over ~1 month. Commodity marketing effects can lag, and FX can mean-revert quickly; using a short period to label a durable \u201ctrend\u201d can be fragile.\n\u2022 Expectation vs observation conflation (handled partially but could be tighter): The Selic forecast (end-2026) is not a current impulse; linking it to FX or selling pressure is speculative without observed FX response.\n\n2) Source specificity\n\u2022 The prior analysis cited specific outlets (Trading Economics; Agrolatam/Safras & Mercado; FocusEconomics; BCB Focus via Xinhua; ADM Investor Services). That is good.\n\u2022 However, some claims were still somewhat generalized (\u201ctends to discourage selling/hedging,\u201d \u201ctighter near-term producer marketing flows\u201d) without direct coffee-specific sourcing in the evidence packet. Those should be explicitly labeled as general market mechanism assumptions rather than evidenced facts.\n\n3) Sentiment tag justification\n\u2022 \u201cBULLISH\u201d is not strongly justified by the provided evidence alone. The evidence supports: (a) BRL strengthened recently, and (b) in soybeans, a stronger BRL is cited as one factor slowing sales. That supports at most a *marginally supportive* signal for Brazilian USD-export commodities, but not a confident bullish stance on Arabica price direction.\n\u2022 A more defensible tag is NEUTRAL-to-slightly-BULLISH, with lower confidence, because the packet lacks coffee-specific flow/positioning/export data.\n\nRevised analysis (improved, tighter, less inferential)\nObserved facts in the packet show BRL appreciation (USD/BRL down to 5.1725 per Trading Economics). Separately, Brazilian soybean commercialization is reported as slow (33.9%\u201338% sold), with \u201cstronger Brazilian real\u201d explicitly cited as one contributing factor alongside low global prices (Agrolatam/Safras & Mercado). This provides direct evidence that, at least in one major Brazilian export crop, recent BRL strength is associated with reduced producer selling.\n\nFor Arabica, the only defensible inference from this packet is a general FX/channel effect: because coffee exports are USD-priced, a stronger BRL can reduce BRL-denominated returns, which *can* lessen farmers\u2019 incentive to sell aggressively in the near term (a potentially supportive, but not decisive, factor). However, the packet does not provide coffee-specific commercialization/export flow data, so the soybean example should be treated as analog evidence rather than confirmation.\n\nOn policy, COPOM holding Selic at 15.00% is an observed fact (FocusEconomics), while the Focus survey projection of 12.25% by end-2026 (BCB/Xinhua) is only an expectation and does not, by itself, imply imminent BRL weakening or increased selling pressure. Therefore, based strictly on the evidence provided, the dominant current macro signal is BRL strength, which is mildly supportive for producer selling restraint\u2014but the overall Arabica directional call should remain cautious.\n\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

(DatamarNews)\n4) [2026-02-19] European Commission placed the EUDR Information System in read-only mode until mid-April 2026 to implement updates after the second postponement. (Mayer Brown / EU Commission)\n5) [2026-02-10] EU Commission will not reopen the EUDR core text but will propose \u2018targeted tweaks\u2019 in April, including potential addition of instant coffee to the regulation\u2019s scope. (Euractiv / Business & Human Rights Centre)\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS\n1) Logical fallacies / reasoning risks:\n- Confirmation bias: The prior write-up selectively framed all items as \u201csupply-supportive\u201d without considering offsets (e.g., record Santos throughput could imply strong export capacity rather than constraint).\n- Recency bias: It overweighted very recent operational headlines (Red Sea routing, port wait times) without establishing persistence, seasonality, or whether coffee flows specifically are materially impacted.\n- False causation / weak linkage: Asia\u2013Europe container rerouting via the Cape does not directly map to Brazil\u2192Europe coffee lanes (often South Atlantic), and Arabica exports are frequently in containers but also depend on carrier service patterns that may not be the same as Asia\u2013Europe strings. The analysis implied a broader effect without evidencing it.\n- Category error: EUDR system read-only status and \u201ctargeted tweaks\u201d were treated as near-term supply tightness, but these are compliance/administrative factors; they may affect trade friction, but the causal chain to futures price is indirect and timing-dependent.\n\n2) Specific sources vs vague claims:\n- Strength: The evidence list cited dated items with named outlets (S&P Global, Kuehne+Nagel, DatamarNews, EU Commission/Mayer Brown, Euractiv/BHRC).\n- Weakness: Several claims in the analysis were not evidenced in the provided facts (e.g., \u201ctighten near-term deliverable availability,\u201d \u201cincrease landed-cost risk\u201d for Arabica) because no data on coffee shipment volumes, demurrage, freight rates, or certified stocks were provided.\n\n3) Sentiment tag justification:\n- \u201cBULLISH\u201d was overstated given the evidence. The Santos data is mixed (congestion risk vs record throughput). Red Sea routing is only clearly relevant if it affects EU container availability, freight rates, or schedule reliability on coffee-related trades\u2014none of which is shown. EUDR issues may increase uncertainty but deadlines were postponed and the system limitation is temporary. Overall, the evidence supports \u201cuncertainty / potential friction,\u201d not a clear bullish conclusion.\n\nREVISED ANALYSIS (IMPROVED)\nThe facts indicate operational and regulatory uncertainty that could create episodic friction in coffee supply chains, but the direct price impact for Arabica is ambiguous without coffee-specific flow/freight metrics.\n\n- Port of Santos (Brazil export gateway): Wait times averaging ~2 days and terminal-specific delays up to 38 hours (Kuehne+Nagel) suggest some congestion/variability risk. However, record January throughput of 12.7m tonnes (Port Authority via DatamarNews) also signals high handling capacity/strong performance. Net: Santos conditions point to scheduling risk more than a clear export shortfall.\n\n- Red Sea/Suez security and carrier routing: CMA CGM\u2019s decision to reroute three Asia\u2013Europe services around the Cape (S&P Global) is a concrete sign that security concerns persist on Suez-linked lanes. This may contribute to broader container network imbalances (equipment positioning, schedule reliability) that can indirectly affect containerized commodities, but the evidence provided does not demonstrate a direct disruption to Brazil\u2192Europe or Brazil\u2192US coffee routes.\n\n- EU EUDR administration: The EUDR Information System being read-only until mid-April and possible scope/implementation tweaks (EU Commission/Mayer Brown; Euractiv) increase compliance uncertainty and could slow onboarding/testing of due-diligence workflows. Because deadlines were postponed and the constraint is temporary, this is more \u201cadministrative friction/uncertainty\u201d than immediate physical supply tightening.\n\nBottom line: Evidence supports a cautious view that logistics and compliance complexity remain elevated, increasing the probability of localized shipment/clearance delays. But it does not, on its own, justify a strongly bullish stance for Arabica futures. A neutral-to-slightly-bullish risk bias would require corroboration from coffee-specific indicators (export loadings, freight rates to EU/US, container availability ex-Brazil, certified stocks, or documented EUDR-related holds).\n\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

[2026-02-14] ICO reported global coffee exports at 11.94 million bags in December 2025, up from 10.81 million bags YoY; Q1 2025/26 exports +5.5% to 33.76 million bags (Source: ICO).\n[ANALYSIS]: SELF-CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS:\n\n1. LOGICAL FALLACIES IDENTIFIED:\n- Confirmation bias is present and significant. The prior analysis weighted every data point toward the bearish conclusion: stock builds are 'unambiguously BEARISH,' backwardation is dismissed as 'residual logistical friction,' short covering is labeled 'tactical not structural,' and even bullish signals (backwardation, dollar weakness) are reframed to support the bearish case. This pattern of selective reframing is a classic confirmation bias signature.\n- False causation: The claim that 279 delivery notices signal 'sellers making supply available' and therefore represent bearish pressure conflates delivery mechanism activity with directional price pressure. Delivery notices in a backwardated market can also reflect arbitrageurs monetizing the roll \u2014 not necessarily net new bearish supply pressure.\n- Recency bias: Two sessions of stock builds (Feb 18 and Feb 20) are characterized as a 'sustained multi-session trajectory,' which overstates the statistical robustness of a two-data-point trend.\n- Anchoring on Conab: The 66.2 million bag Brazil 2026 projection is a forward-looking estimate (not yet realized supply) cited as a 'structural BEARISH anchor.' Projections carry uncertainty; treating them as confirmed supply is an anchor fallacy.\n\n2. SOURCE CITATION QUALITY:\n- Sources are generally specific (StoneX, CocoaIntel, ICO, Barchart) and dated, which is a strength.\n- However, the Conab 66.2 million bag projection referenced in the analysis is NOT listed in the evidence block \u2014 it is imported from prior context without a grounded citation in this evidence set. This is a transparency failure.\n- The ICO Composite Indicator at 296.89 cents and the 279 cents cash price reference also do not appear in the listed evidence. These were cited in analysis as grounded fact but are unverified within this evidence set.\n\n3. SENTIMENT TAG JUSTIFICATION:\n- The BEARISH tag has meaningful support: two consecutive sessions of certified stock builds, robust global export growth, and active delivery issuance are legitimately bearish near-term signals.\n- However, the persistent backwardation (-10.95 cents March\u2013December) is a structurally BULLISH curve signal that was too aggressively discounted. Backwardation of nearly 11 cents over 9 months is not trivial noise \u2014 it reflects genuine market pricing of near-term physical tightness.\n- The 15-month price low consolidation with short covering and dollar weakness introduces a legitimate bottoming signal that was dismissed without sufficient counter-argument.\n- A more honest assessment is that the evidence is MIXED, with bearish signals dominant on inventory and macro supply, but bullish signals present on curve structure and price action. BEARISH is defensible but should not carry high conviction.\n\nREVISED ASSESSMENT:\nThe net directional lean remains BEARISH, but with explicitly acknowledged counterweights. Certified stock builds across two consecutive sessions (+14,935 bags Feb 18, +9,638 bags Feb 20) are the strongest near-term bearish signal, sourced from StoneX. Global export growth of +5.5% YoY (ICO, Feb 14) confirms robust supply flow. These are concrete, sourced, near-term bearish inputs. Against this: the forward curve's persistent backwardation (-10.95 cents March\u2013December per CocoaIntel Feb 18) is a legitimate bullish structural signal that should not be casually dismissed as logistics friction without additional evidence of spread compression actually occurring. The 279 delivery notices (StoneX, Feb 20) are ambiguous \u2014 they indicate seller activity but occur within a backwardated structure, limiting their standalone bearish interpretive weight. The Feb 23 short covering and dollar-driven bounce (Barchart) is noted as a tactical signal but insufficient alone to reverse the directional lean. Critically, the Conab projection and ICO Composite price data cited in the prior analysis are not present in the current evidence block and should not drive the conclusion. Stripping those ungrounded references, the evidence-supported conclusion is a moderate bearish lean, not a high-conviction bearish call. Confidence is LOW given the two-session stock build sample size, the unresolved bullish backwardation signal, and the absence of Feb 23 certified stock data.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.55\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(2) While a record Brazilian harvest is clearly supply-bearish, the analysis ignored demand variables (e.g., signs of recovering out-of-home consumption, growth in soluble demand, or potential weather threats). Assuming supply growth automatically means lower prices risks the post-hoc fallacy because markets may have discounted the news. (3) Technical commentary was narrow, focusing only on the 200-day SMA; including shorter-term averages and volatility measures would paint a fuller picture.   \n\nUpdated assessment: Prices remain 11 % below the 200-day SMA, confirming that the broader trend is still down. Momentum is mixed: RSI at 49 is neutral, MACD marginally negative, and the 20-day SMA (292 US\u00a2) sits above spot, implying near-term resistance. Volatility (14-day ATR \u2248 10.6 \u00a2) has contracted, suggesting consolidation rather than capitulation. Failure to hold the 284 \u00a2 pivot now makes 270 \u00a2 (Nov-2024 low) the next technical target; a daily close back above 292 \u00a2 would be needed to question the down-trend.   \nFundamentals tilt cautiously bearish: CONAB\u2019s 17 % y/y production increase in Brazil points to ample 2026/27 supply, and ICE certified stocks have been trending higher since December. However, tail-risks exist: the majority of Brazil\u2019s crop is still in the field, and any late-cycle weather shock (e.g., colder-than-normal June\u2013July) could trigger sharp short-covering. Moreover, speculative positioning is already net-short 11.8 k lots (CFTC, 13 Feb), limiting fresh selling capacity.   \nBottom line: The weight of evidence (sub-SMA pricing, soft momentum, large crop expectations, rising exchange stocks) supports a BEARISH bias, but with moderated conviction given shrinking volatility and crowded short positions. Traders should watch 270 \u00a2 support and 292 \u00a2 resistance for confirmation of the next directional move.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
