[2026-02-26] AccuWeather 10-day forecast for Minas Gerais shows daily rain or thunderstorms with high temperatures of 25-29\u00b0C and high humidity \u2014 consistent with ongoing wet conditions. 2. [2026-02-26] StoneX estimates the 2026/27 Brazilian coffee crop will reach an all-time record of 70.7 million 60kg bags, a 13.5% increase from the previous cycle. 3. [2026-02-20] Arabica prices hit seven-month lows following reports of 'ample rainfall' in Minas Gerais over the prior two weeks. 4. [2026-02-06] Official forecasts project Minas Gerais will harvest 32.4 million bags, specifically citing 'improved rainfall ahead of flowering' and during development as a key driver. 5. [2026-02-12] Climate Impact Company noted a 'patchy wet bias' in East Brazil with heavy rainfall expected to consolidate over the 8-14 day period.\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: (1) CONFIRMATION BIAS risk: The original analysis selectively emphasized bullish crop data (StoneX 70.7M bags, Conab 66.2M bags) while dismissively treating the humidity/disease risk as unconfirmed and therefore negligible. Absence of evidence of disease outbreak is not evidence of absence \u2014 the original analysis used this logical gap to reinforce the bearish price conclusion without adequately flagging it as a material unquantified risk. (2) FALSE CAUSATION risk: The original analysis correctly distinguished between rainfall supporting fruit maturation (2025/26 crop) versus pre-flowering soil moisture (2026/27 cycle), which is agronomically sound. However, it did not sufficiently acknowledge that persistent heavy rainfall during bean-filling can also cause cherry splitting, increased rot, and harvest delays \u2014 mechanisms that are supply-bearish in the short term but could reduce realized yield vs. forecast yield, introducing upside price risk not captured by the bearish sentiment tag. (3) VAGUE SOURCING: The reference to 'Conab-aligned estimates of 66.2M bags' appears in the analysis but NOT in the evidence packet \u2014 this is an unsupported claim introduced without citation, which undermines analytical integrity. (4) SENTIMENT JUSTIFICATION: The BEARISH tag is directionally supported by the evidence (record crop forecasts, seven-month price lows already realized, no confirmed weather disruption), but the confidence of 0.3 (low) contradicts a clean BEARISH tag \u2014 low confidence should have prompted a NEUTRAL tag or explicit acknowledgment of the tension. REVISED ASSESSMENT: The dominant evidence is supply-side bearish: StoneX record forecast (70.7M bags, cited [2026-02-26]), seven-month Arabica price lows already realized ([2026-02-20]), and a 10-day wet forecast supportive of continued fruit development ([2026-02-26]). However, two underweighted risks temper conviction: (a) prolonged high humidity raises unquantified Coffee Leaf Rust and cherry rot risk, and (b) the Conab 66.2M bag figure cited in the prior analysis lacks sourcing in this data packet and should be treated as unverified. The bearish directional call is justified but confidence remains LOW-to-MODERATE given unquantified disease/harvest execution risks and the gap between forecast yields and realized yields. Sentiment tag is revised to BEARISH but with explicit acknowledgment that a sharp disease or harvest disruption event could rapidly flip this to NEUTRAL or BULLISH on prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.55\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

[2026-02-26] Market forecasts project USD/BRL at 5.16 end-of-quarter and 4.97 in 12 months, implying continued BRL strength trajectory (Exchange Rates UK). 3. [2026-02-25] Technical analysis shows USD/BRL has broken below the 61.8% Fibonacci level with momentum toward 5.00 psychological support (Daily Forex). 4. [2026-02-24] Brazilian soybean sales for current harvest at 36%, trailing the 44% rate from last year and 43% historical average (Cultivar Magazine). 5. [2026-02-23] Focus Market Readout confirms market expectations for Selic easing cycle to begin March 2026, with Copom unanimously holding at 15% for the fifth consecutive meeting (Banco Central do Brasil / Eurasia Review).\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: (1) False causation / proxy weakness: The bullish supply-restraint argument rests on soybean sales data as a behavioral proxy for coffee farmer selling. This is a cross-commodity extrapolation with no direct coffee-specific sales data cited. Soy and coffee have different seasonal dynamics, storage characteristics, and price drivers. The causal link, while plausible, is inferred rather than directly evidenced. (2) Confirmation bias: The prior analysis dismissed the Selic easing signal \u2014 a meaningful BRL-weakening catalyst \u2014 as 'prospective rather than observed,' while treating the BRL appreciation trend as dominant. Both are real signals; selectively weighting the observed over the prospective without quantifying the easing timeline risk introduces directional bias. (3) Recency bias: The 1.07% BRL appreciation over one month is treated as a durable trend driver. Currency moves of this magnitude over 30 days are noisy; the technical level (5.00 psychological support) has not yet been tested, and the forecast range (5.16 end-quarter vs. 4.97 in 12 months) actually implies near-term stability or slight BRL weakness before longer-term strength. (4) Vagueness on coffee-specific flows: No coffee export volume, GCA inventory, or ICO trade flow data is cited. The bullish thesis is built entirely on currency and proxy data. REVISED ASSESSMENT: BRL appreciation at current levels (5.1258) does create a mild disincentive for Brazilian producer selling, and the directional evidence supports modest supply-flow restraint. However, the Selic easing cycle \u2014 with the first cut potentially as soon as March 2026 \u2014 represents a credible near-term headwind to further BRL strength, which could erode the supply-restraint thesis within weeks. The end-quarter forecast of 5.16 (slightly weaker BRL vs. spot) reinforces that further appreciation is not consensus. Without direct coffee-specific farmer selling or export flow data, the bullish conviction level must be moderated. The net signal remains marginally bullish for Arabica on origin flow dynamics, but the cross-commodity proxy reliance and imminent policy inflection point materially reduce confidence relative to the prior 0.77 rating.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

(S&P Global) 2) [2026-02-19] Port of Santos reached record January throughput of 12.7 million tonnes (+9.5% y/y), driven by agribusiness exports \u2014 indicating sustained high-volume pressure on the port.

(ResourceWise)\n[ANALYSIS]: **Self-Critique Before Revision:**\n\n**1. Logical Fallacies Identified:**\n- *Confirmation bias* is the primary risk. All five evidence points are interpreted through a bullish lens without adequately stress-testing bearish counterarguments. For example, record Santos throughput (+9.5% y/y) could equally indicate that the port IS successfully handling elevated volumes \u2014 i.e., throughput growth may reflect capacity adaptation rather than pure congestion. The analysis selectively interprets this as congestion evidence rather than throughput efficiency.\n- *False causation*: The analysis chains logistical delays \u2192 reduced physical Arabica availability \u2192 bullish pricing without establishing that these specific bottlenecks are the marginal price driver at this time. Other price factors (harvest estimates, demand softening, currency movements, speculative positioning) are absent and may dominate.\n- *Recency bias*: The 73% roaster unpreparedness figure is carried forward from prior periods without a timestamp or source reassessment in this data packet \u2014 it is treated as current fact but is unverified in the present evidence.\n- *Scope mismatch*: CMA CGM's Cape routing applies to Asia-Europe lanes, not Brazil-Europe. Arabica from Santos moves on Brazil-Europe routes, which may have different carrier profiles. Applying Asia-Europe routing uncertainty to Brazil-origin Arabica supply chains is an indirect inference, not a direct causal link.\n\n**2. Source Specificity:**\n- Sources are named (S&P Global, DatamarNews, Mayer Brown, ResourceWise) with dates, which is adequate. However, the prior-period baseline data (vessel wait times, terminal utilization 63-86%) has no source cited in this packet \u2014 it is imported from prior analysis without grounding in the current evidence set. This weakens evidentiary rigor.\n\n**3. Sentiment Justification:**\n- BULLISH sentiment is directionally defensible given persistent logistical friction, but the confidence of 0.76 is likely overstated given: (a) the scope mismatch on Red Sea routing applicability to Brazil-Europe Arabica lanes, (b) the ambiguity of record throughput as either congestion or adaptation, (c) the reduced EUDR enforcement pressure from the December 2026 deadline postponement which partially offsets compliance friction, and (d) absence of demand-side or futures positioning data.\n\n**Revised Analysis:**\n\nThe evidence confirms logistical friction across ocean routing, Santos port throughput, and EUDR compliance \u2014 but the bullish interpretation requires qualification on several dimensions.\n\n**Red Sea / Ocean Transit:** CMA CGM's continued Cape routing for Asia-Europe lanes is a confirmed data point, but its direct relevance to Brazil-Europe Arabica shipments is inferential. Brazil-origin coffee moves on South Atlantic routes where carrier routing decisions may differ from Asia-Europe configurations. The congestion risk from a rapid mass Suez return remains a valid secondary risk but is speculative absent confirmation of imminent carrier migration. Net effect: moderate lead-time uncertainty for EU-bound Arabica, not a strong direct constraint.\n\n**Port of Santos:** Record January throughput of 12.7 million tonnes is a dual-signal data point. It confirms high volume pressure but also demonstrates the port processed record cargo \u2014 suggesting some capacity absorption capability. The expansion authorization confirms structural strain recognition by authorities, but this is a medium-to-long-term signal with no near-term relief implication. Prior congestion metrics (vessel waits, utilization rates) are carried forward from unspecified prior periods and should be treated as background context rather than current confirmed data. Near-term rollover risk for Arabica exports is plausible but not directly evidenced in this packet.\n\n**EUDR Compliance:** The system access limitation through mid-April 2026 creates a genuine operational friction window for compliance workflow testing. However, the December 30, 2026 enforcement deadline postponement materially reduces urgency for near-term supply chain disruption from compliance failures. The April 30 simplification review introduces uncertainty but also the possibility of reduced compliance burden \u2014 a potential bearish offset not acknowledged in the original analysis. The 73% unpreparedness figure requires fresh sourcing to remain credible.\n\n**Net Assessment:** Logistical bottlenecks are present but their direct price-bullish transmission to Arabica markets is less mechanically certain than the original analysis implies. Santos throughput is high but not clearly capacity-breaking in this data window. Red Sea routing uncertainty has indirect rather than direct applicability to Brazil-Europe Arabica lanes. EUDR friction is real but partially offset by enforcement deadline extension. Sentiment remains cautiously BULLISH on supply-timing grounds, but confidence is reduced to reflect scope limitations and inferential gaps. Demand-side and futures positioning data remain absent, limiting the completeness of the price outlook.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

High Port of Santos utilization (85-90%) and persistent bottlenecks (~1,824 containers/month blocked) constrain capacity despite declining global freight rates, indicating local chokepoints prevent full export potential. Absent demand data, this points to tighter near-term global Arabica supply availability.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

[2026-02-05] Conab projects Brazil 2026 Arabica crop at 44.1 million bags, +23.2% YoY; total crop 66.2 million bags (Source: Barchart/Conab).\n[ANALYSIS]: SELF-CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS: 1. LOGICAL FALLACIES IDENTIFIED: The prior analysis exhibited recency bias by treating the single-session 4,525-bag draw as a directional signal worthy of sentiment adjustment ('slightly reduced intensity'), despite immediately acknowledging it is 'within noise range.' This is internally contradictory \u2014 a signal acknowledged as noise should not shift sentiment intensity at all. Additionally, the Robusta draw inference (cross-commodity substitution dynamics) constitutes a weak false causation: Robusta load-outs do not mechanically support Arabica prices via substitution without explicit demand-side evidence, and citing this as 'minor indirect support' overstates the inference. 2. SOURCE SPECIFICITY: Sources were adequately cited with dates and outlets for all five evidence points. No vague claims on sourcing. However, the backwardation evidence is dated Feb 21, making it four days stale by the analysis date of Feb 25-26 \u2014 this lag was not flagged as a limitation, which is an analytical gap. 3. SENTIMENT JUSTIFICATION: The BEARISH tag is justified by the evidence, but the confidence score of 0.38 (LOW) is appropriate given mixed short-term signals. The pending grading queue of 171,080 bags growing above the Feb 18 level of 143,758 bags is the strongest near-term bearish signal and was correctly identified as the dominant leading indicator. REVISED ASSESSMENT: The minor draw of 4,525 bags on Feb 24 is noise-level and should not modulate sentiment direction or intensity. The pending grading queue at 171,080 bags \u2014 its highest observed recent level \u2014 is the single most actionable near-term signal and strongly implies renewed certified stock builds in the 2-5 session horizon, consistent with prior documented patterns. The forward curve backwardation (source dated Feb 21, now potentially stale) reflects ICE-delivery mechanism friction rather than fundamental supply deficit, per established analytical framework. The Robusta draw is noted as an isolated observation without direct Arabica price transmission evidence and is excluded from the primary sentiment determination. The Conab record crop projection remains the dominant structural bearish anchor for medium-term price direction. No confirmation bias correction is needed on the bearish conclusion, but the prior analysis erred in partially softening sentiment on a noise-level draw while simultaneously holding a growing pending queue signal \u2014 these two positions were inconsistent. Net sentiment is BEARISH with LOW confidence given the ambiguity of short-term stock flow signals, but the pending grading trajectory is the most reliable near-term directional indicator available.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.55\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(source: Conab via Barchart)\n[ANALYSIS]: The Coffee C futures price of 282.89 USd/Lbs remains well below the 200-day SMA of 302.46, reflecting a sustained bearish long-term trend with lower highs and lows, primarily due to anticipated oversupply from Brazil's record 2026/27 Arabica production forecast of 66.2 million bags, which is likely to exceed global demand and exert downward pressure. While the RSI of 27.74 signals oversold conditions for the KCH7 contract, and a bullish divergence in RSI and Stochastic near the 280 support level hints at potential short-term rebound or stabilization, these technical factors alone do not counteract the fundamental supply overhang without signs of robust demand growth or external bullish catalysts like weather disruptions.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",
