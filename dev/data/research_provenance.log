NEW INSIGHT from MACRO:
[EVIDENCE]: - 2026-02-17: March Arabica coffee futures (KCH26) closed -5.15% in one session; Barchart attributes the move in part to an improving supply outlook and a rising U.S. Dollar. (Barchart)
- 2026-02-18: Fed minutes due; markets looking for confirmation of a prolonged pause in rate cuts. (Investing.com)
- 2026-02-18: March Arabica fell 5.36% to 283.95 c/lb, lowest since July 2025. (Vietnam.vn)
- 2026-02-16: Coffee futures down ~29.5% YoY; pressured by expectations of +23% Brazilian Arabica production in 2026. (Logos Press)
- 2026-02-05: Brazil Conab projected a record 2026 coffee crop of 66.2M bags. (Trading Economics)
[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS
1) Logical fallacies / reasoning risks
- Potential false causation / oversimplification: I implied a fairly direct chain (hawkish minutes → stronger USD → coffee down). The evidence only shows (a) markets *anticipating* minutes and (b) one selloff that Barchart says was partly due to a rising USD. That does not prove the minutes (or hawkishness) caused the USD move or the coffee move.
- Confirmation bias: I weighted evidence consistent with a bearish narrative (USD strength + record Brazil crop) and did not explicitly consider countervailing factors (e.g., weather risk, logistics, demand, positioning). Those aren’t in the packet, so I shouldn’t imply the case is comprehensive.
- Recency bias: I leaned heavily on the most recent two sessions and treated them as validating the macro channel, without acknowledging short-term volatility and that commodity moves can be driven by multiple simultaneous factors.

2) Specificity of citations
- Strength: I did cite specific dated items and attributed key claims (USD mentioned as a contributor: Barchart; Fed minutes expectation: Investing.com; price level/percent move: Vietnam.vn; Brazil crop expectations: Conab via Trading Economics; YoY decline and +23% claim: Logos Press).
- Weakness: The original wording suggested the minutes themselves were hawkish (“hawkish pivot shock”) even though the packet only states markets were *looking for confirmation* of a pause in cuts. That is a subtle but important overreach.

3) Sentiment tag justification
- Directionally justified but should be more conditional: The packet supports a bearish bias via (i) explicit mention that a rising USD contributed to a sharp selloff and (ii) multiple references to a larger Brazilian supply outlook. However, the strength of the claim about a Fed-driven shock should be toned down because the minutes outcome is not reported—only anticipated.

REVISED (IMPROVED) ANALYSIS
FACTS FROM THE PACKET: Arabica sold off sharply (-5.15% on 2026-02-17 per Barchart; -5.36% to 283.95 c/lb on 2026-02-18 per Vietnam.vn), reaching the lowest level since July 2025. Barchart explicitly cites two contemporaneous drivers for the one-day drop: (1) improving supply outlooks and (2) a rising U.S. Dollar. Separately, the supply narrative is reinforced by reports of a record/large 2026 Brazil crop (Conab 66.2M bags per Trading Economics) and expectations of +23% Brazilian Arabica production in 2026 (Logos Press), alongside a ~29.5% YoY decline in coffee futures (Logos Press).

INTERPRETATION (macro minutes risk as *potential* headwind): The Fed minutes event (Investing.com) matters here mainly as a *risk factor* for USD strength: if the minutes confirm “higher-for-longer”/a prolonged pause in cuts, that could support the USD. The packet does not prove causality from minutes → USD → coffee, but it does provide direct evidence that USD strength is being cited by at least one market source (Barchart) as a bearish input for Arabica during the observed selloff. Therefore, the most defensible inference is conditional: any USD-supportive Fed communication would likely add macro headwinds to Arabica.

NET IMPLICATION FROM PROVIDED FACTS: The dominant, better-supported driver in this packet is bearish supply expectations (record Brazil crop projections) plus an observed risk-off/macro headwind (USD strength cited alongside the selloff). With no bullish offsets provided in the packet, the balance of evidence skews bearish for Arabica in the near term, while noting uncertainty about the exact contribution of Fed minutes versus other simultaneous drivers.
