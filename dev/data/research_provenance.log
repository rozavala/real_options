NEW INSIGHT from MACRO:
[EVIDENCE]: - [2026-02-17] March Arabica (KCH26) closed down 5.15% with reports citing bumper Brazil crop prospects and a stronger USD as headwinds. (Nasdaq / Barchart)
- [2026-02-18] Arabica coffee priced around 282.72 USd/lb, a ~7.25-month low, down ~20% over the prior month. (Trading Economics)
- [2026-02-05] Conab projected Brazil’s 2026 coffee harvest at ~66.2m bags (+17.2% y/y), described as record/very large. (Nasdaq)
- [2026-01-30] Reporting linked Trump’s nomination of Kevin Warsh to succeed Powell with a ‘hawkish pivot’ narrative and a stronger USD. (Wedbush / MarketPulse)
- [2026-02-18] FOMC minutes (Jan 27–28) were upcoming, with commentary that markets were looking for potential hawkish signals. (FXStreet / FinanceFeeds)
[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS
1) Logical fallacies / reasoning risks
- False causation / over-attribution: I implied a Fed-policy “shock” was a key driver of Arabica weakness. The evidence only shows (a) commentary about hawkishness supporting USD and (b) at least one market wrap explicitly citing a stronger USD alongside Brazil crop prospects. That supports “USD strength can be a headwind,” but does not prove Fed expectations were the dominant cause of the coffee move.
- Confirmation bias: I selected only bearish elements (USD up, Brazil crop up, prices down) and did not note missing/unknowns (e.g., Brazil weather risks, certified stocks, demand/roaster buying, positioning, real/BRL moves, logistics). The packet itself is one-sided, but my language made the conclusion sound more comprehensive than the inputs.
- Recency bias: I leaned heavily on very recent price action (one-day -5.15%, near-term low) to generalize the broader outlook, without distinguishing short-term momentum from medium-term fundamentals.

2) Specificity of sourcing
- Strength: I did cite specific items (KCH26 -5.15% with stronger USD + Brazil crop prospects; Conab 66.2m bags +17.2% y/y; Trading Economics level and 1-month drop; Warsh nomination linked to USD strength; FOMC minutes expectations).
- Weakness: Some claims were phrased too strongly relative to the citations (e.g., calling it a clear “policy shock transmission” or suggesting an unambiguous hawkish shift). The FOMC-minutes item is about anticipation, not an actual outcome.

3) Sentiment tag justification
- Bearish is directionally supported by the evidence provided: prices are falling to multi-month lows, one report directly attributes downside to stronger USD plus bigger Brazil supply expectations, and Conab’s forecast points to supply expansion. However, the tag should be tempered because causality and persistence (whether USD strength continues; whether the crop materializes as forecast) are not established in the packet.

REVISED ANALYSIS (IMPROVED)
The evidence set supports a near-term bearish bias for Arabica driven by (1) an improving supply outlook in Brazil and (2) a macro headwind from USD strength.

On fundamentals, Conab’s projection of a very large/record 2026 Brazil crop (~66.2m bags, +17.2% y/y) is a clear bearish input to expectations for global balance, and market commentary on 2026-02-17 explicitly pairs “bumper crop prospects” with price weakness.

On macro, several items describe a USD-supportive narrative (hawkish pivot talk tied to the Warsh nomination; markets watching for hawkish signals in forthcoming minutes). Importantly, at least one price report explicitly links a stronger USD with that day’s Arabica decline, which is consistent with the common mechanism that USD appreciation can pressure USD-denominated commodities.

That said, the packet does not prove the Fed narrative is the primary driver of the broader ~20% one-month decline; it only supports that USD strength likely contributed at the margin alongside dominant supply expectations. With no offsetting bullish demand or weather-loss evidence included, the balance of provided information remains bearish, but with moderate confidence due to attribution uncertainty and missing variables.

Analyze impact on Cocoa prices.
NEW INSIGHT from MACRO:
[EVIDENCE]: - Trading Economics (2026-02-18): Cocoa prices at $3,279.52/ton, -5.38% day/day, described as ~70% below the late-2024 peak.
- Trading Economics (2026-02-18): ICE cocoa inventories rose to 1,942,367 bags, a 4.25-month high.
- Ecofin Agency (2026-02-12): Ghana cut the cocoa farmgate price by 28.6% to 41,392 cedis (~$3,764) for the remainder of the 2025/2026 season.
- Reuters (2026-02-18): Ivory Coast is considering cutting its guaranteed farmgate price to align with Ghana’s reduction.
- Morningstar (2026-02-18): Investors are focused on a “higher bar” for future Fed rate cuts ahead of release of January FOMC minutes.
[ANALYSIS]: Critique of the prior analysis (what was weak):
- Potential confirmation/recency bias: I leaned heavily on same-day price weakness and rising inventories to justify a bearish frame, without explicitly acknowledging that these are near-term indicators and may not alone establish a sustained trend.
- Risk of false causation / overreach: I implied that a hawkish Fed tilt is a macro headwind for cocoa, but the packet provides no direct USD/FX data, no cross-asset correlation evidence, and no cocoa-specific demand data. That linkage is plausible, but not demonstrated by the packet.
- Over-inference on farmgate cuts: I treated Ghana’s (and potential Ivory Coast) farmgate price cuts as “consistent with pressure to move beans/unsold stocks.” The packet states the price decisions but does not explicitly attribute motive (surplus, unsold stocks, policy, FX). My interpretation could be correct but was not proven within the provided facts.
- Source specificity: I did cite sources for the key facts (Trading Economics, Ecofin, Reuters, Morningstar), but some causal language (“typically reduce the need for higher international prices to clear supply”) was generalized and not tied to packet-specific evidence.

Improved analysis (more disciplined to the packet):
- Facts vs. the alert: The packet does not substantiate a specific “May 22” hawkish pivot; it only says markets were awaiting January FOMC minutes and that investors perceive a “higher bar” for future rate cuts (Morningstar). So any claim about a particular date-driven pivot is unsupported by the packet.
- Cocoa market state per packet: The most direct cocoa-specific indicators in the packet are (a) a sharp spot price level and daily decline ($3,279.52/t; -5.38% day/day; Trading Economics) and (b) rising exchange inventories to a 4.25-month high (1,942,367 bags; Trading Economics). Taken together, these two facts are consistent with weaker near-term pricing and looser nearby availability than earlier.
- Producer pricing policy signals: Ghana’s 28.6% farmgate price cut (Ecofin) and Ivory Coast’s consideration of a similar cut (Reuters) indicate reduced guaranteed producer prices in the main supply region. The packet does not explicitly state why, but the direction of these policy moves is aligned with lower price expectations/realizations in the near term rather than tightening conditions.
- Macro overlay (limited by packet): The “higher bar” for future Fed cuts (Morningstar) suggests less-easy monetary expectations than a dovish scenario. The packet does not provide USD moves or commodity-wide risk sentiment, so this can only be treated as a secondary/conditional headwind rather than a demonstrated driver.

Bottom line: Based strictly on the packet, the balance of evidence is bearish-to-neutral for near-term cocoa pricing because the only direct market metrics shown are falling prices and rising exchange inventories, alongside producer farmgate price reductions/considerations that align with lower pricing. However, because causality (especially from Fed expectations) and demand conditions are not evidenced in the packet, conviction should remain low-to-moderate.
