2026-02-19 16:31:39,865 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. This trade presents a textbook pre-mortem failure profile: we are entering a directional short at a 1st-percentile crowded positioning extreme, anchored to a 14-day-old catalyst that is likely already priced, in a market with confirmed physical backwardation, fighting a high-correlation cross-asset macro regime, with elevated IV that amplifies loss velocity if wrong. The confidence rating of 0.7 is NOT supported by the underlying agent consensus of 0.54. The gap between the proposed 0.7 and the model's 0.54 is itself a red flag suggesting motivated reasoning in the synthesis layer. If the trade is taken, catastrophic failure via short squeeze within 5 days is a higher-probability outcome than the gradual supply-narrative grind lower that the bearish thesis requires. At minimum, reduce position size to 25% of standard, define a hard stop at 292 cents (as flagged by the technical agent), and DO NOT add on weakness without reassessing COT data. The correct posture given the evidence is FLAT, waiting for either (a) COT positioning to normalize above 25th percentile, or (b) certified stocks to cross 500,000 bags confirming the supply pipeline is genuinely opening.

2026-02-19 16:41:13,692 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. The trade fails the pre-mortem test on multiple independent grounds: (1) The primary weighted consensus agent (agronomist, highest weight) submitted corrupted non-coffee data, making the entire consensus architecture unreliable; (2) Entering a short at the 1st percentile of speculative net length with a Z-score of -2.30 is timing entry into maximum squeeze vulnerability, not a strong fundamental short; (3) The 0.7 confidence level is inconsistent with a desk consensus of 0.54 NEUTRAL and with the explicit acknowledgment that the trade 'cannot be proven'; (4) Backwardation persisting at -10.95 cents contradicts the narrative that the supply pipeline is already opening; (5) IV at 48-52% means a short futures position faces an asymmetric volatility risk where a squeeze move could easily exceed 15-20 cents in 5 days. If the bearish thesis is to be expressed at all, the correct vehicle is long put spreads (defined risk, benefits from high IV if timed correctly on a vol crush) — NOT outright short futures at current prices, current positioning, and current volatility levels. Wait for either: (a) a failed bounce to 295-300 with confirmed technical rejection, or (b) COT positioning to normalize above the 20th percentile before re-entering the short thesis.
