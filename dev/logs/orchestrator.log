2026-01-28 13:57:35,043 - trading_bot.signal_generator - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED trade: REJECT THIS TRADE. The confidence of 0.88 is dangerously overinflated given multiple red flags: (1) We're buying into an overbought market that dropped 2.36% in the last 24 hours - this is textbook confirmation bias, clinging to the supply narrative while ignoring price action screaming exhaustion. (2) The weighted consensus score of only 0.242 with 0.54 confidence contradicts the proposed 0.88 confidence - someone is cherry-picking the bullish reports. (3) Three of seven agents are bearish (geopolitical, technical, volatility) but their warnings about overbought conditions and expensive premiums are being dismissed. (4) We're succumbing to NARRATIVE BIAS - the Brazilian weather/supply story is compelling but already priced in at these levels.
