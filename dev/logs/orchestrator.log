2026-01-28 13:57:35,043 - trading_bot.signal_generator - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED trade: REJECT THIS TRADE. The confidence of 0.88 is dangerously overinflated given multiple red flags: (1) We're buying into an overbought market that dropped 2.36% in the last 24 hours - this is textbook confirmation bias, clinging to the supply narrative while ignoring price action screaming exhaustion. (2) The weighted consensus score of only 0.242 with 0.54 confidence contradicts the proposed 0.88 confidence - someone is cherry-picking the bullish reports. (3) Three of seven agents are bearish (geopolitical, technical, volatility) but their warnings about overbought conditions and expensive premiums are being dismissed. (4) We're succumbing to NARRATIVE BIAS - the Brazilian weather/supply story is compelling but already priced in at these levels.

2026-01-28 14:04:53,297 - trading_bot.signal_generator - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED trade: DO NOT PROCEED. This trade fights the dominant consensus (BULLISH at 0.53 confidence with 0.233 weighted score) and ignores critical supply-side evidence. The bearish case rests primarily on weather improvement, but the market already priced in a -2.85% move. Meanwhile, four high-confidence agents (supply_chain 0.95, volatility 0.90, macro 0.85, sentiment 0.85) are BULLISH. The agronomist's bearish call assumes weather relief translates directly to price decline, but structural supply bottlenecks at Santos and currency dynamics create a floor. The technical setup shows overbought conditions BUT above all major moving averages - this typically resolves with consolidation, not collapse. Wait for either: (1) a break below 347 (200-day SMA) confirming bearish trend, or (2) supply chain normalization evidence before initiating bearish positions.

2026-01-28 14:04:57,789 - trading_bot.signal_generator - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED trade: ABORT TRADE IMMEDIATELY. The weighted voting shows NEUTRAL consensus (0.57) with a near-zero weighted score (-0.038). We are attempting to force a BEARISH trade with 0.85 confidence when 4 of 7 agents signaled BULLISH (Supply Chain, Inventory, Macro, Sentiment) and only 3 signaled BEARISH (Agronomist, Geopolitical, Volatility). The 'Respect the Trend' principle was cherry-picked to justify a -2.32% 24h move as confirmation, but the 5-day trend remains +1.69% positive. We succumbed to CONFIRMATION BIAS by weighting weather improvements over hard logistics data, and RECENCY BIAS by extrapolating a single day's decline into a trend. The steepest backwardation in years and rapid inventory drawdowns are screaming BULLISH supply tightness - weather improvements 6+ months out cannot offset immediate physical scarcity. A short squeeze against the 'heavy' positioning (68,000 lots open interest) could trigger a violent move higher.

2026-01-28 14:10:21,152 - trading_bot.signal_generator - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED trade: We fell prey to confirmation bias by overweighting negative short-term factors and succumbing to recency bias by focusing mainly on recent price declines without sufficiently considering the broader market dynamics or potential corrective measures. The consensus confidence was relatively low and neutral, yet we tilted towards a bearish interpretation by overemphasizing bearish agent reports and recent short-term price action without adequately balancing the bullish supply chain and inventory cues. Additionally, we underestimated the potential resolution of geopolitical issues and variables affecting currency exchanges and managed money positions. Considering these risks, the data was either ignored or misinterpreted by focusing too heavily on immediate logistical hurdles without adequately accounting for newer developments or macroeconomic shifts that could rapidly reverse bearish outlooks. Verdict: We should NOT proceed with the trade at this time, as the signals are mixed, risks are high, and the current data does not convincingly support a bearish stance.
