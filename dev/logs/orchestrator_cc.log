2026-02-19 17:12:02,442 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED at current entry conditions. The 0.9 confidence rating is dangerously inflated and reflects multiple critical biases that a pre-mortem exposes immediately. BIAS ANALYSIS: (1) RECENCY BIAS — the entire thesis is anchored to a 3-day, -16.44% move; we are extrapolating momentum into a price that has already discounted much of the bearish fundamental shift. (2) CONFIRMATION BIAS — 6 of 7 agents are bearish, creating an echo chamber where contrary signals (technical analyst's median CFTC positioning, European Q4 grindings +3% YoY, neutral geopolitical conclusion) were systematically downweighted. (3) CROWDED TRADE RISK — entering a short AFTER a -45% YTD move and -16.44% over 3 days is the definition of a crowded, late-cycle bearish trade with minimal reward-to-risk. DATA IGNORED OR MISINTERPRETED: (a) The technical agent noted European Q4-25 cocoa grind ROSE 3% YoY — this directly contradicts the 'demand destruction' narrative but was buried in caveats. (b) CFTC managed-money positioning is NOT at extreme shorts, meaning the fuel for a short-squeeze EXISTS. (c) The 700k ton bottleneck was framed as 'bearish deferred supply' but is equally a BULLISH catalyst if resolved upward via policy action. (d) A -16.44% move in 3 days in an already illiquid agricultural futures contract means bid-ask spreads widen dramatically, slippage on entry/exit is severe, and the actual realized P&L on a forced exit will be far worse than model prices suggest. VERDICT: The trade has already happened. The edge was 3 days ago. Entering now at $3,069 with 0.9 confidence is overfit to past price action. If trade is taken at all, position size must be reduced by 70%, hard stop must be placed at $3,350 (approx. +9%), and the 700k ton Ivory Coast policy announcement must be monitored in real-time as the primary invalidation trigger.

2026-02-19 17:14:53,613 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED with a new bearish position at current price levels (3066). The trade thesis is structurally sound on fundamentals but tactically dangerous for five critical reasons: (1) The entry point is AFTER a 45% YTD decline and a 7.31% single-day crash - the easy money on the short side is already made; (2) The 700,000-ton Ivorian dispute resolution represents an asymmetric binary risk that could gap the market 10%+ against shorts within days; (3) Consensus bearishness across all agents signals crowded positioning with minimal remaining alpha and maximum squeeze vulnerability; (4) HIGH_VOLATILITY regime means any stop placement must be wide enough to absorb 5-8% daily swings, destroying risk/reward on new shorts; (5) The technical analyst's own consolidation target of $2,900-3,200 suggests we are ALREADY near fair value on the bearish case, with upside risk to $3,400+ on any catalyst. If conviction exists, wait for a technical RETEST of breakdown levels (3200-3300 range) to enter with defined risk, rather than chasing a market in free-fall. The confidence rating of 0.70 is INSUFFICIENT to justify a new directional position in a HIGH_VOLATILITY commodity that has already priced in most of the bearish thesis.
