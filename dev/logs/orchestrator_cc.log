2026-02-20 16:52:23,785 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. This trade fails the most basic risk management test before even evaluating direction. The portfolio is already at 400% VaR utilization — this is not a borderline breach, it is an extreme, disqualifying condition. The PORTFOLIO RISK ALERT explicitly instructs preference for strategies that REDUCE correlation with existing positions; adding or maintaining a bearish cocoa position is the exact OPPOSITE of that instruction. The directional thesis may be correct — fundamentals are genuinely bearish — but correct direction with catastrophic sizing and forced-liquidation risk is not a trade, it is a lottery ticket with house odds. The 0.9 confidence on direction is seductive and likely reflects confirmation bias (every agent is bearish, sentiment is at 2.1/10, the trade 'feels' obvious). That unanimity IS the risk: when every signal points the same way, the crowded-trade reversal risk is maximal, not minimal. SPECIFIC ACTION REQUIRED: (1) Immediately reduce existing cocoa short exposure to bring VaR under 3% limit — this is non-negotiable per stated risk parameters. (2) Do not initiate any new bearish cocoa exposure. (3) If directional conviction remains after sizing down, consider a defined-risk structure (long put spreads rather than outright futures) but only after VaR normalization. (4) Revisit in 5-7 days once inventory data, Côte d'Ivoire farmgate decision, and weekly grind indicators provide confirmation the thesis is playing out without forced exit risk.

2026-02-20 16:57:50,920 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. This trade fails on risk management grounds alone before any directional analysis is relevant. The portfolio is at 401% VaR utilization — adding any bearish cocoa exposure in a HIGH_VOLATILITY regime with an existing KC position is reckless and violates all stated risk limits. The directional thesis may well be correct, but: (1) The portfolio cannot survive the volatility required to be proven right. (2) The trade is maximally crowded — a 29% monthly drawdown means every bear is already in, leaving asymmetric squeeze risk to the upside. (3) Key bearish pillars contain interpretive leaps: grind seasonality was dismissed without evidence, Rabobank's material surplus downward revision was minimized, and arrival data actually shows Ivory Coast supply running 4.4% below YoY. (4) The confirmation bias embedded in a 0.9 confidence BEARISH call when 7 of 8 agents are bearish is a classic crowded-consensus red flag — this level of unanimity typically precedes reversals, not continuations. IMPERATIVE ACTION: Reduce existing KC position to bring VaR below limit before considering any new directional exposure. If directional bearish exposure is desired after de-risking, use defined-risk options structures only.
