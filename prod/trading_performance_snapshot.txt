=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
- Technical + Volatility: Both explicitly tie the downtrend to bumper-crop expectations; volatility analysis frames downside continuation as still underpriced relative to realized moves (i.e., market not “done” moving).
- Sentiment/positioning: COT data indicates depressed speculative length and rising shorts; that supports the notion of a market positioned for (and still leaning into) bearish supply confirmation rather than one primed for sustained upside.

3) Bull’s main pillar (logistics squeeze) is real but time-horizon limited and weaker as a directional driver here: The supply-chain report shows a sharp YoY export drop and Santos execution issues, and the inventory report confirms low ICE stocks/backwardation (near-term tightness). However, other packets (geopolitical) explicitly downgrade the inference from Red Sea disruptions to coffee-specific shortages, and the inventory report itself frames the market as a tug-of-war. Net: the logistics/inventory tightness is credible as a *short-term* support risk, but it does not outweigh the improving crop/weather evidence plus the ongoing price cascade.

4) Evidence counting / synthesis: Bearish direction is supported by agronomy + Conab (fundamentals), technical momentum (including the -5.0%/3-day trigger), and sentiment/positioning (re-risking lower). Bullish support is concentrated in logistics + near-term inventories, but those are partially offset by the geopolitics report’s corridor-specific caveats and by the fact that global freight indices are easing (reducing the “cost shock” element of the squeeze).

5) Volatility cost awareness: The volatility analyst is bearish and does not flag options as expensive; no required downgrade for “expensive options” applies. Still, because there is genuine near-term tightness evidence (ICE stocks/backwardation/exports), conviction is capped at PLAUSIBLE rather than PROVEN.

Verdict on the debate: The Bear better integrates the current price action (including the -5.0% three-day move) with the dominant fundamental driver in the packet (improving Brazil supply outlook). The Bull’s logistics squeeze argument is valid but is not demonstrated as the dominant, durable driver capable of reversing a liquidation move absent a new weather shock (which is not present—weather is currently supportive). [DA VETO: LOGISTICS SQUEEZE INTENSIFIES: The supply-chain report documents Santos port infrastructure exhaustion (73% vessel delay rate, 1,824 containers/month unshipped) and a 30% YoY export collapse. While we dismissed this as 'time-horizon limited,' a continued physical inability to move beans creates a delivery crisis. ICE stocks at 428k bags (already stressed per inventory report) could fall further, triggering a violent short squeeze as March expiry approaches. The short COT positioning (1st percentile net longs) becomes fuel for a melt-up if physical tightness persists another 2-3 weeks.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.48, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.48, ""contribution"": -0.384}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.66, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 1.0, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.93, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 1.24, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 1.24, ""contribution"": 0.992}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.93, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 2.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.4, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.79, ""contribution"": -0.636}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 4.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.66, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 2.97, ""contribution"": -1.933}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.75, ""reliability_mult"": 0.52, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.91, ""contribution"": -0.728}]",technical,0.0,PriceSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,"Brazil supply outlook remains improving (record Conab crop forecast reinforced by wet bean-filling weather), aligning with a momentum-led selloff (-5.0% over 3 days; ~20% over a month).",1.0,"The strongest counter-argument is the confirmed near-term tightness: January exports down sharply, Santos bottlenecks (containers left behind/vessel delays), low ICE-certified stocks and backwardation—conditions that can spark short-covering rallies. I override it because the dataset also shows improving Brazil crop conditions and a record harvest forecast, and price is already repricing that forward supply (including the -5.0%/3-day cascade). Without an overwhelming new weather shock or definitive evidence that logistics constraints will materially persist through peak harvest, the logistics/inventory story is more a volatility/support risk than the dominant directional catalyst."
