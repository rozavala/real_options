=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

Fundamentals vs “weather shock”: The Agronomist report is directionally bearish—rain during grain filling tends to support bean weight, and the major hard datum is Conab’s record harvest forecast. The bull’s attempt to convert “thunderstorms/cloud cover/fungal risk” into a decisive supply shock is not supported by concrete evidence of realized damage; it is a plausible risk, but not yet a demonstrated catalyst strong enough to override the larger, explicit supply projection.

Positioning/backwardation: The bull is correct that speculative positioning is extremely depressed and that backwardation can signal nearby tightness; those are legitimate independent bullish *setups*. However, they are not, on their own, a supply-shock proof. The bear’s framing is more grounded: washed-out specs can produce a bounce, but without a new confirmed tightening impulse, it’s hard to argue for a sustained upside regime change against a large Brazil crop narrative.

Macro/BRL and logistics: The bull leans on BRL strength discouraging selling and on shipping friction. The Macro specialist explicitly warns this is theoretical (no coffee-specific flow/hedging data) and potentially short-horizon/reversible (conditional March easing). The Geopolitical report is explicitly mixed/uncertain and does not evidence Brazil-coffee-specific bottlenecks (Santos has traffic, but no delay metrics). On evidence quality, the bear is more disciplined in downgrading these from “drivers” to “risks to monitor.”

Evidence counting / synthesis: Multiple independent reports (Agronomist + Technical + the bearish interpretation of sentiment/liquidation) align on a supply-expansion + bearish-trend backdrop. The bullish case is mostly a mean-reversion/positioning argument plus conditional risks (weather, FX, logistics) that are not yet confirmed to be tightening supply. That makes the bear’s argument more grounded in the current data.

Volatility-cost rule: The volatility report is not coffee-specific and does not establish that options are expensive for this market, so no mandated downgrade is applied from that rule—but conviction is still capped because oversold/washed-out positioning can generate sharp countertrend rallies.
