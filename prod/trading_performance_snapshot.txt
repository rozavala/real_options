=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
[ANALYSIS]: The market is 13 % below its 200-day SMA, confirming medium-term downward momentum. An RSI hovering just above 30 flags short-term oversold conditions, raising the probability of a technical bounce; however, oversold oscillators alone rarely reverse established trends without a clear catalyst.  Fundamentally, the prospect of a record Brazilian harvest (≈37 % of global output) is a credible bearish driver, yet the figure is still a forecast—subject to weather risk during the bloom-to-harvest window—and much of that news may already be priced in.  Demand indicators (roaster margins, certified-stock drawdowns, global consumption growth) are absent from the current dataset, so the supply narrative may be overstated.  Price’s breach of the S1 pivot at 291 ¢ and inability to reclaim 300 ¢ reinforce near-term bearish control, but follow-through selling volume is required to confirm a fresh leg lower toward 275 ¢ (next chart support).  In sum, prevailing evidence tilts bearish, yet the oversold reading and forward-looking nature of the crop data introduce two-way risk.  Traders could expect rallies into 295-310 ¢ to face selling unless new bullish data (e.g., weather damage, stronger demand, currency weakness) emerge.

[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",BEARISH,"[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-13] KCK26 Implied Volatility (35.92%) is trading at a discount to 20-day Realized Volatility (~40%). [2026-02-17] Prices ($2.86-$3.00/lb) are testing 6-month lows. [2026-02-13] Brazil's 2026 production forecast is a record 66.2 million bags (+17.2% YoY).
[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis incorrectly labeled the environment as a 'LOW_VOL' regime; while Implied Volatility (IV) is cheap relative to Realized Volatility (RV), an absolute IV of ~36% indicates a high-volatility environment. The revised view maintains a BEARISH sentiment but refines the thesis: the market is mispricing risk by offering option premiums at a discount (IV < RV) despite the looming 'Green Tsunami' supply shock (+17.2% YoY production). While prices are at 6-month lows, the fundamental weight of record supply suggests support levels may break, validating a directional short strategy. Buying options (Long Put) remains the optimal approach, not because volatility is 'low', but because it is statistically undervalued relative to the asset's recent velocity.
[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8
[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",NEUTRAL,0.0,"Trend/price action is decisively bearish: the market is down roughly 3.9% on the day (well beyond the -1.5% threshold), which per the framework should be treated as technical liquidation rather than a “buy-the-dip” setup unless an overwhelming new weather shock exists. The bear’s case is more grounded in current data because multiple independent lines point the same way: (1) fundamentals—CONAB projections for a record Brazil crop/large YoY increases (Agronomist, Inventory, Technical); (2) availability—ICE certified stocks are building, indicating supply is reaching deliverable channels despite narratives of scarcity (Inventory); (3) flow—global shipments were up YoY (ICO), supporting the idea that the pipeline is not structurally starved (Inventory); and (4) technical/positioning—price is well below the 200-day SMA, momentum signals are weak, RSI is not yet oversold, and funds have been de-risking (Technical). The bull’s strongest evidence is the Cecafé-reported 30.8% YoY drop in January Brazil exports plus ongoing Santos bottlenecks (Supply_chain), which is real and independently supported by logistics commentary (Geopolitical). However, the bear correctly characterizes this as primarily a timing/distribution constraint, not a confirmed production loss, and that interpretation is reinforced by the simultaneous evidence of rising exchange stocks and strong crop expectations.

URGEN T TRIGGER (São Paulo drought 19.6mm, severity 7/10, “vegetative”, neutral direction): this does add tail-risk, but it fails the “overwhelming shock” test required to override the liquidation signal because it is contradicted by other weather reporting in the packet citing floods/intense storms/supportive moisture in São Paulo and by the stage mismatch (agronomist argues grain-filling rather than vegetative). Net: the drought alert looks localized/ambiguous versus the broader, better-corroborated bumper-crop narrative, so it is not strong enough to flip direction.

Volatility cost awareness does not force a downgrade here: the volatility analyst characterizes premiums as “cheap” versus realized volatility (not expensive), so there is no required reduction in thesis_strength. Still, given the mix of a real localized logistics constraint (bullish near-term) versus dominant supply/price-trend signals (bearish), the conclusion is BEARISH but not “proven.” [DA VETO: Scenario 1 (Weather shock reprices supply): Within 5 days, credible, widely-followed sources (Cooxupé/Conab updates, private meteorologists) confirm that the ‘localized’ São Paulo dryness was real, broader than assumed, and occurring at a yield-sensitive stage (grain filling), triggering fast downgrades to Brazil 2026/27 Arabica potential. The market gaps higher, shorts scramble, and the trade is stopped out before fundamentals can be revalidated.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 3.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.48, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.44, ""contribution"": -1.152}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.66, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 0.63, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 0.44, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.24, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 1.78, ""contribution"": 1.423}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 1.33, ""contribution"": -1.064}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.4, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.6, ""final_weight"": 0.4, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.66, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 1.42, ""contribution"": -0.924}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.4, ""reliability_mult"": 0.52, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 0.7, ""contribution"": -0.556}]",supply_chain,0.0,WeatherSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,Record/bumper Brazil crop expectations corroborated by rising ICE certified stocks and a sharp downside price break that signals liquidation in a supply-heavy regime.,1.0,"The strongest counter is the bull’s claim of a genuine near-term physical squeeze: Brazil exports down sharply YoY with Santos bottlenecks persisting even at lower volumes, plus backwardation suggesting tight nearby supply.
