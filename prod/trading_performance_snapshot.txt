=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

The volatility/squeeze thesis is the Bull's weakest link. While IV at 38.86-51.19% (Vol Report) appears elevated, the 5-day realized volatility is only 1.73% (MODERATE per Market Data)—this is not the explosive realized vol of a genuine squeeze. The backwardation cited (Mar '26 @ 281.15 vs Mar '28 @ 244.95) is narrowing as the market prices in the 2026 harvest glut, a classic transition toward contango structure in oversupply environments. The pending stock surge (+18,663 bags) and Inventory's assessment that flow is 'attracting delivery' confirm the backwardation is being arbitraged away, capping upside. The Bear correctly identifies this as a 'liquidity trap masking fundamental decay.'

The EUDR delay to December 2026 (Geopolitical Report, ResourceWise) removes the last potential bullish catalyst—no rush-to-ship compliance premium exists for Q1/Q2. The oversold RSI of 27.74 (Technical Report) does create tactical bounce risk, but in a RANGE_BOUND regime (not trending), oversold conditions resolve through sideways chop rather than sustained rallies. The Technical Report's resistance at 342 and support at 244.35 (52-week low) frames asymmetric risk: limited upside to 296.44 SMA vs. significant downside to 244.35.

EVIDENCE COUNTING: Six independent lines converge bearish: (1) Record harvest fundamentals (Agronomist, Inventory), (2) Currency mechanics favoring liquidation (Macro), (3) X Sentiment spike on 'declining prices' (Sentinel), (4) Price 14.3% below SMA in distribution regime (Technical), (5) Pending stock surge indicating supply normalization (Inventory), (6) EUDR delay removing demand catalyst (Geopolitical). Only Supply Chain and Volatility dissent, but their arguments rely on temporary friction (port delays) and technical squeeze risk contradicted by moderate realized vol.

VOLATILITY COST AWARENESS: The Volatility Report's elevated IV (38.86-51.19%) with BULLISH sentiment tag signals expensive options. Per Decision Framework Rule 5, this normally downgrades thesis_strength. However, the Vol Analyst recommends SELLING volatility via bull put spreads—a bearish-neutral strategy exploiting fear premium—which paradoxically aligns with the bearish directional view. This does not justify downgrading from PLAUSIBLE to SPECULATIVE because the Vol desk's 'bullish' tag refers to trade structure (selling puts), not directional conviction. The high IV actually reinforces bearish positioning by making short strategies attractive.

WEIGHTED CONSENSUS validates the verdict: Bearish direction at -0.149 score with 0.54 confidence, dominated by Supply Chain agent but supported by Agronomist, Inventory, Sentiment, and Technical (4 of 7 agents bearish). The Bull's arguments rest on temporary logistics and oversold technicals—both time-limited factors against permanent structural oversupply. [DA VETO: LOGISTICAL SCARCITY INFLECTION: The bearish thesis treats Santos port congestion (73% delay rates, 61-day waits) and the 30.8% Brazilian export collapse as temporary friction, but fails to model the nonlinear dynamics of infrastructure failure. If port capacity doesn't recover within 2-3 weeks, the physical shortage intensifies exponentially—certified stocks (453,612 bags) represent only ~34 days of global consumption. The pending stock surge (+18,663 bags) could stall if Brazilian hoarding persists longer than the 'end-March' BRL depreciation forecast. We assumed supply normalization is inevitable, but the 2021 Vietnam robusta squeeze precedent shows logistics can create 6-month dislocations. The backwardation (Mar '26 @ 281.15 vs Mar '28 @ 244.95) isn't being 'arbitraged away'—it's steepening as the market reprices scarcity duration risk. CATASTROPHIC SCENARIO: Prices rally 18-25% to 335-340 resistance as roasters panic-buy before Q2 demand, triggering the exact volatility squeeze the Vol Report warned about (IV 38-51%, call skew flattening).

This is a high-quality, evidence-based argument with 0.8 confidence. I override it because: (1) The Agronomist confirms the +20% harvest is progressing favorably through bean-filling, meaning delayed supply will eventually arrive into an oversupplied market, (2) Pending ICE stocks surging +18,663 bags (StoneX) prove supply is rerouting through certification channels despite congestion—physical coffee is not destroyed, merely delayed, (3) Vietnam's 38.3% export surge demonstrates global supply chains remain functional outside Brazil, and (4) The X Sentinel alert's themes 'approaching production costs' and 'potential retail price drops' reflect forward-looking market positioning for the inevitable supply flush once logistics normalize. Temporary friction does not justify fighting a structural bear wave with asymmetric downside risk to 244.35 support vs. limited upside to 296.44 resistance. The Bear's framing is correct: 'Port congestion is a logistics cost, not a supply destruction event.'"
