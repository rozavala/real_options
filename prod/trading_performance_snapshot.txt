=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

2) Evidence counting (independent lines): Several reports converge on the same bearish driver from different angles: (a) Conab’s record 2026 production outlook and higher projected Arabica output (macro/geopolitical/volatility/inventory/technical all cite this), (b) improving Brazil growing conditions (rainfall cited as supportive of the crop outlook), and (c) improving near-term availability signaled by rising ICE-certified stocks. That is a coherent, multi-source narrative.

3) “Priced in” and the X activity spike: The URGENT trigger (15-post X spike) is explicitly assessed as low-confidence and driven by claims (70–100% YoY gains) that contradict verified price data showing Arabica down materially YoY and near 15-month lows. This makes the spike more consistent with noisy/misinformed chatter than a new tradable catalyst. It therefore does not qualify as an “overwhelming new weather shock” that would justify fading the bearish trend.

4) Hegelian synthesis: The bull’s best point is real—near-term logistics (export drop, port delays) plus backwardation can create localized tightness and spark sharp countertrend rallies, especially if positioning is net-short. However, the bear better connects current depressed price action to the dominant forward-looking driver the market is reacting to: expectations of materially higher Brazil supply. With no confirmed acute weather damage in Brazil in the packet (if anything, rainfall improves the outlook), the bull’s supply-shock claim is weaker than the bear’s surplus thesis.

5) Volatility cost awareness: The volatility analyst is directionally bearish and does not provide evidence that options are “expensive” (IV metrics are N/A rather than flagged high). So no additional downgrade is required under the rule, but conviction remains capped because the tape shows two-way risk (oversold/covering rallies).

Net: The bear’s argument has more and better-aligned evidence with current market conditions (downtrend + surplus outlook), while the bull relies on mean reversion and short-term frictions that are plausibly temporary and already reflected in the market’s “technical bounce” framing. [DA VETO: SCENARIO 1 - Weather Shock Override: A sudden frost, hailstorm, or prolonged drought hits Brazil's Arabica belt in the next 5 days, immediately erasing the 'record crop' narrative. The 113% rainfall in Minas Gerais was a backward-looking metric; we ignored that coffee is entering the critical February-March fruiting stage where ANY adverse weather can slash yields by 20-30%. The market reprices violently upward (+15-25% in 48 hours), stopping out bearish positions. We fell victim to RECENCY BIAS by anchoring to the latest Conab production estimate without stress-testing it against the 6-8 week weather-risk window still ahead.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.9, ""staleness_weight"": 0.75, ""age_hours"": 3.5, ""final_weight"": 1.01, ""contribution"": 0.808}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 0.75, ""age_hours"": 3.5, ""final_weight"": 0.73, ""contribution"": -0.474}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 0.76, ""age_hours"": 3.4, ""final_weight"": 0.74, ""contribution"": -0.479}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.02, ""staleness_weight"": 0.71, ""age_hours"": 3.9, ""final_weight"": 1.08, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.85, ""staleness_weight"": 0.71, ""age_hours"": 3.9, ""final_weight"": 0.91, ""contribution"": -0.726}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.71, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.06, ""contribution"": -0.85}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.89, ""staleness_weight"": 0.71, ""age_hours"": 3.9, ""final_weight"": 1.42, ""contribution"": -0.924}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0499999999999998, ""reliability_mult"": 0.74, ""staleness_weight"": 0.76, ""age_hours"": 3.4, ""final_weight"": 0.59, ""contribution"": -0.471}]",technical,0.0,XSentimentSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,"Brazil supply outlook shifting toward surplus (Conab record-crop projection, reinforced by improved Brazil rainfall and rising ICE-certified stocks), keeping pressure on a market already trading well below its long-term trend.",1.0,"The strongest counter-argument is the bull’s claim that near-term physical tightness (export collapse, Santos delays) plus backwardation and oversold/short positioning can trigger a sharp rebound.
