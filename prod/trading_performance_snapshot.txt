=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

3. LOGISTICAL FRICTION VS DEMAND DESTRUCTION (Bear advantage): The Geopolitical and Supply_Chain reports document severe bottlenecks (Santos 'exhausted,' Mombasa forcing 8x air freight costs, 10.5% global fleet congested). The Bull interprets this as a bullish supply shock. The Bear's rebuttal is decisive: the EUDR delay to December 30, 2026 removes the regulatory catalyst that would justify paying premium logistics. Without urgent demand-side pull, high friction costs simply compress margins and discourage purchases—this is demand destruction, not scarcity premium. The Geopolitical analyst explicitly concludes 'NEUTRAL' sentiment because 'the market enters a high-cost, high-friction stasis rather than a rally.'

4. MARKET DATA VALIDATION: Current price at 267.10 is 10.4% below the 200-day SMA (298.25), confirming a sustained downtrend. The -1.07% 5-day trend and -0.22% 24h change show continued weakness, not stabilization. The Sentiment report shows managed money reduced net longs to just 2,220 lots—institutions are exiting, not accumulating. The Technical analyst, despite noting oversold RSI/Stochastic divergence, concludes BEARISH sentiment because 'without a confirmed moving average crossover or demand-side catalysts, the oversupply outlook dominates.'

5. VOLATILITY COST PENALTY (Critical constraint applied): The Volatility report explicitly states option premiums are 'expensive' relative to realized volatility. Per the Decision Framework Rule 5, this BEARISH volatility sentiment forces a downgrade in thesis strength. While multiple independent signals support the Bear case (Inventory, Agronomist, Technical, Sentiment all BEARISH with 0.65-0.8 confidence), the expensive options market reflects elevated uncertainty. This prevents elevation to 'PROVEN' and anchors the verdict at 'PLAUSIBLE.'

EVIDENCE COUNTING: Four independent analysts (Agronomist, Inventory, Technical, Sentiment) reach BEARISH conclusions via different pathways—weather/crop fundamentals, inventory pipeline analysis, technical breakdown, and positioning data. The two BULLISH reports (Macro, Supply_Chain) and one NEUTRAL (Geopolitical) present valid observations but fail to address the timing mismatch: current bottlenecks are real, but the pending inventory surge and record crop will arrive in Q2 2026 regardless of BRL strength or port congestion.

DEBATE VERDICT: The Bear wins on superior integration of leading indicators (pending stocks) versus lagging indicators (current backwardation), pragmatic assessment of withholding sustainability under cash flow pressure, and correct interpretation of logistical friction as demand-destructive absent the EUDR catalyst. The Bull's defense relies on current market structure (backwardation, export declines) that will reverse once pending stocks certify and harvest completes.

This mechanism is economically sound and supported by the 10pp lag in soybean sales cited in the Macro report. I override this argument because: (1) The 15% Selic rate that supports the Real also creates severe financing costs for farmers, making prolonged withholding financially unsustainable—this is a self-limiting mechanism; (2) The pending grading stocks at 171,080 bags indicate supply is already moving through certification channels despite BRL strength, proving the withholding is incomplete; (3) The Agronomist's clearing weather forecast from Feb 28 will enable harvest completion, at which point storage costs and quality degradation risks will force sales regardless of FX levels. The withholding creates a temporary floor, not a structural supply constraint, and the market is correctly pricing in the eventual release via the 10.4% discount to the 200-day SMA."
