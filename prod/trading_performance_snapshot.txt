=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

2) Evidence counting / independence: Multiple specialist reports independently converge on the same core bearish driver—Brazil supply expectations and improving availability. Inventory shows ICE-certified stocks rising and Conab projecting a large Arabica increase; Geopolitical and Macro both cite the market’s lows being attributed to Brazil’s bumper outlook; Technical shows price materially below the 200-day SMA (trend still down) with rebounds framed as short-covering; Sentiment report adds Vietnam export strength as an additional supply-side corroboration. This is several different “angles” pointing to the same conclusion (supply pressure + downtrend).

3) Trend respect: While the prompt’s “24h Change” liquidation rule can’t be applied (no 24h change is provided), the broader trend evidence is clearly bearish: price is well below the 200-day SMA, and recent commentary repeatedly frames up-moves as technical bottom-fishing/short-covering after multi-month lows. That supports the bear’s view that rallies are suspect until proven fundamental.

4) Hegelian synthesis (oversold vs supply shock): The bull makes a valid point that the market looks oversold/positioning-sensitive and that near-term frictions exist (Brazil exports down YoY, Santos delays, backwardation). However, those are either (a) time-horizon issues (delays/withholding can coexist with an approaching large crop) or (b) not consistently bullish in this packet (ICE stocks are rising; multiple sources attribute weakness to anticipated Brazil supply). The agronomist’s Vietnam heat-risk is a longer-dated climate concern and is not yet a concrete, immediate “new weather shock” severe enough (in this dataset) to override the supply-glut narrative.

5) “Priced in” check: The bull cites small daily gains; these are explicitly labeled technical. There is no evidence of a sustained upside repricing on new bullish fundamentals. So the bull’s claim of a momentum shift is weaker than the bear’s claim that bounces are positioning-driven within a bearish fundamental frame.

Overall, the bear’s case is better supported by current, commodity-specific fundamentals (Conab crop outlook + rising certified stocks + additional supply corroboration) and by the characterization of recent strength as technical rather than fundamental. [DA VETO: CAPITULATION RALLY RISK: Price at 285.45 is at 15-month lows with 17.42% monthly decline and below 200-day SMA of 319.17. Markets at extreme lows are positioning powder kegs - technical report explicitly notes 'oversold conditions' and 'potential weather risks that can spark sharp rallies.' The 14-post social media spike (vs 3.3 baseline), despite low confidence, may signal early accumulation by commercials who see value at these levels. We are selling AFTER a 27.41% YoY crash when smart money may be buying.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.9, ""staleness_weight"": 0.9, ""age_hours"": 2.0, ""final_weight"": 1.21, ""contribution"": 0.97}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 0.9, ""age_hours"": 2.0, ""final_weight"": 0.87, ""contribution"": -0.569}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 0.91, ""age_hours"": 1.9, ""final_weight"": 0.88, ""contribution"": -0.574}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.02, ""staleness_weight"": 0.86, ""age_hours"": 2.4, ""final_weight"": 1.31, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.85, ""staleness_weight"": 0.86, ""age_hours"": 2.4, ""final_weight"": 1.1, ""contribution"": -0.88}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.71, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.06, ""contribution"": -0.69}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.89, ""staleness_weight"": 0.86, ""age_hours"": 2.4, ""final_weight"": 1.72, ""contribution"": -1.12}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0499999999999998, ""reliability_mult"": 0.74, ""staleness_weight"": 0.91, ""age_hours"": 1.9, ""final_weight"": 0.71, ""contribution"": -0.565}]",technical,0.0,XSentimentSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,"Broad-based supply normalization/expansion signal: Brazil’s record-crop outlook (Conab) reinforced by rising ICE-certified stocks, with rebounds repeatedly attributed to technical short-covering/bottom-fishing rather than new fundamental tightness.",1.0,"The strongest counter-argument is the bull’s near-term tightness/mean-reversion setup: backwardation, Brazilian export declines and port delays, plus oversold technical conditions could drive sharp short-covering rallies.
