=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

2) Coffee-specific fundamentals (independent of macro): Several specialist reports converge on improved availability: ICE-certified stocks rose and pending grading increased, both consistent with easing nearby tightness. Separately, Brazil supply expectations are described as record/very large (Conab and StoneX forecasts). These are distinct lines of evidence (deliverable inventory + production outlook) pointing the same direction and they directly address the commodity’s fundamentals. The Bull’s main fundamental rebuttal—Brazil exports down sharply YoY—was acknowledged even by the Supply Chain report as likely upstream timing/retention rather than a structural logistics constraint, and it does not override the fact that certified stocks are still rising.

3) Mandatory trigger: Fed Policy Shock (HAWKISH_PIVOT): The May 22 minutes signal “various” participants willing to tighten further if inflation risks materialize. This is a clear shift toward higher-for-longer, which the Sentinel briefing explicitly expects to lift USD and yields and pressure gold/industrial commodities; the desk’s macro/sentiment inputs also tie USD firmness to commodity pressure. The Bull argues macro causality is “unproven,” but the debate standard here is grounding in current data, and the hawkish pivot is a direct, high-severity catalyst that aligns with broader bearish risk appetite and carry dynamics for commodities.

4) Evidence counting / synthesis: Most desks (Macro, Geopolitical, Inventory, Sentiment, Technical, Volatility, Agronomist) are independently bearish for different reasons: macro tightening impulse, rising certified stocks, large Brazil crop outlook, broad weak pricing, and trend-following technicals. The Bull relies heavily on a single outlier (Supply Chain bullishness from export decline) plus backwardation/“tightness” interpretation. Backwardation is acknowledged in the Inventory report but is treated as residual/nearby structure that is being contradicted by rising certified stocks—making it weaker as a standalone bullish catalyst.

5) Volatility cost awareness: The Volatility analyst is also bearish and frames downside risk as dominant; while explicit IV-expensiveness wasn’t provided, the volatility desk does not support paying up for upside convexity. That keeps the overall thesis from reaching “PROVEN,” but it does not negate the multi-factor bearish tilt.

Net: The Bear’s argument better matches the weight of evidence and the current macro shock regime. However, because some bearish inputs are forward-looking (Brazil forecast) and the export-drop/upstream tightness could still create intermittent squeezes, the call remains PLAUSIBLE rather than PROVEN. [DA VETO: SUPPLY SHOCK REVERSAL: Brazil weather deteriorates sharply in next 5 days (late-season frost, excessive rain during drying) destroying the 'record crop' narrative. The 66.2M bag Conab forecast becomes obsolete. ICE certified stocks at 449K bags are historically LOW (multi-year lows per context), meaning any supply disruption triggers violent short squeeze. We mistook 'rising from extreme lows' for 'adequate supply'.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.96, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 0.48, ""contribution"": -0.385}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 3.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.94, ""contribution"": -1.259}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.3, ""contribution"": -0.844}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.96, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.96, ""contribution"": 0.765}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.81, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.4, ""contribution"": -0.322}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.75, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.5, ""contribution"": -0.976}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 2.1, ""contribution"": -1.365}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.4, ""reliability_mult"": 0.74, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.04, ""contribution"": -0.831}]",technical,0.0,MacroContagionSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,Fed hawkish pivot (“higher-for-longer”) reinforcing a macro headwind while coffee-specific availability indicators (rising ICE-certified stocks + record Brazil crop forecasts) point to easing supply tightness.,1.0,"Strongest counter-argument is the Bull’s claim that Brazil’s sharp export decline plus persistent backwardation signals real upstream tightness that could trigger a squeeze, especially with RSI near oversold. I override it because deliverable availability is currently improving (ICE-certified and pending grading rising) and the hawkish Fed pivot is a high-severity, near-term macro headwind; together these reduce the probability that the export datapoint represents a durable, tradeable supply shock rather than timing/retention noise."
