=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

Debate verdict (who is more grounded): The Permabear’s case is more consistent with the full packet. The most independently corroborated driver is fundamentals: agronomy/weather evidence (frequent showers, “very good outlook for cherry development”) plus Conab’s record 2026 crop projection. Multiple reports (Agronomist, Technical, Volatility, Inventory, Sentiment) converge on “supply headwinds + bearish tape,” even while acknowledging oversold conditions.

On the bull’s key pillar (Santos bottleneck): The supply-chain evidence is real (Jan exports down sharply; reported vessel delays), but the bull over-extends it into a definitive near-term scarcity thesis. The Geopolitical/logistics report shows current average waits that are not acute and explicitly warns that coffee-specific delay impact is unproven. Meanwhile, ICE certified stocks are rising, which undermines the claim of an immediate, destination-market shortage. Backwardation does signal nearby tightness, but the Inventory report frames it as likely to normalize given rising certified stocks + record crop expectations, which aligns more with the bear interpretation than with a sustained bullish shock.

Positioning/technicals: Both sides cite liquidation and oversold signals; however, the bear is more correct to treat this as capitulation within a downtrend rather than proof of reversal. The bull’s “flush = rally” argument is plausible only as a tactical bounce, not a higher-quality catalyst than the expanding supply outlook.

Volatility cost awareness: The volatility analyst flags elevated IV (options expensive), which is sentimentally bearish and increases the cost of expressing a bullish reversal view. This forces a downgrade in conviction and favors staying aligned with the dominant fundamental trend unless the physical shock is overwhelming—which it is not, given conflicting logistics indicators and rising certified stocks.

Evidence counting: Bearish has more independent lines pointing the same way (weather/agronomy + Conab crop size + bearish technical structure + speculative long liquidation + rising certified stocks + global exports growth). The bull relies heavily on one channel (port delay) plus weaker/indirect support (FX via soybean proxy) and a mean-reversion read of oversold.
