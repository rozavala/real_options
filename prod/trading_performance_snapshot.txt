=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
- Supply-risk context: WeatherSentinel flags a HIGH-severity drought condition in São Paulo (19.6mm vs 30mm threshold) during the vegetative stage. Even though the tool tags direction as NEUTRAL, agronomically a drought alert is plausibly an upside price risk factor (supply uncertainty) but the packet provides no quantified yield/production impact or propagation to coffee-growing regions beyond the alert label. Treat this as a qualitative risk flag, not a confirmed bullish driver.
- Macro headwind context: MacroContagionSentinel’s 'HAWKISH_PIVOT' is described as USD-bullish and broadly commodity-bearish. This is a generic cross-asset relationship and is not coffee-specific in the evidence; it should be treated as a potential headwind rather than a definitive driver.
- Sentiment/noise: XSentimentSentinel shows an activity spike and positive themes ('futures rally'), but the confidence is very low (0.21), so it should not materially influence a positioning or volatility-pricing conclusion.

Net: With missing IV rank/percentile/skew, the only defensible stance is that the volatility/pricing question cannot be answered from this packet. Directionally, the remaining evidence is mixed and low-resolution (qualitative supply-risk flag vs generic macro headwind), supporting a NEUTRAL tag and LOW confidence.
[CONFIDENCE]: 0.55
[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",NEUTRAL,0.0,"BLOCKED BY COMPLIANCE: (1) Hallucination/unsupported technical claims: Decision cites 'price sitting well below the 200-day SMA' and a 'range-bound regime' plus 'technical liquidation/weak demand for risk'—none of the reports provide any SMA/200DMA, regime classification, volume/flow liquidation data, or other technical indicators. The Technical report explicitly says no spot/term-structure prices, RSI, moving averages, or volume data were located, so the 200DMA assertion is not supported by evidence.
(2) Data gap presented as decisive: Using 'trend/respect-the-tape is decisive' relies on missing technical context; only 24h (-4.98%) and 5-day (-3.19%) moves are provided in Market Context, which do not justify the specific 200DMA/range-bound conclusions.
(3) No clear ignored critical risk: The reasoning does acknowledge the São Paulo drought risk flag and the heavy-rain forecast risk; it does not omit an explicitly stated critical risk.
(4) Not contradictory to report sentiment: Reports are mostly NEUTRAL with one BEARISH (Agronomist) and one BULLISH (Technical).

I override it because, in this packet, that shock is not quantified or corroborated (sentinel is direction-neutral; no inventory/curve tightening evidence), and the framework explicitly penalizes buying into a large negative 24h move unless the shock is overwhelming."
