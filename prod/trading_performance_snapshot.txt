=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

**2. Supply Chain 'Bottlenecks' Are Clearing Faster Than Coffee-Specific Disruptions Can Sustain Tightness (Bear Wins on Evidence Quality):** The Permabull cites January exports down 30.8% and 486,300 bags delayed in December as evidence of 'persistent' bottlenecks. However, the Geopolitical Report documents Port of Santos achieving RECORD throughput of 12.7M tonnes (+9.5% YoY) in February 2026, explicitly 'debunking fears of a supply trap.' The -2% futures drop following EUDR delay (2026-02-20) confirms the market is pricing RELIEF from regulatory risk, not sustained tightness. The Containerized Freight Index falling 14.16% over one month to 1251.46 further demonstrates easing logistics costs. The Bull's argument relies on December/January data while ignoring February's resolution evidence—classic recency bias. The coffee-specific delays are real but transient, overwhelmed by the structural clearing trend.

**3. Speculator Positioning and Technical Breakdown Signal Capitulation Into Oversupply, Not a Coiled Spring (Bear Wins on Consensus):** Five of seven specialist reports tag BEARISH (Agronomist, Geopolitical, Inventory, Sentiment, Technical), with weighted consensus at -0.206 and 0.60 confidence. Non-commercial net-longs fell 8% to just 12,860 contracts, managed money reduced to 2,220 net lots—historically low positioning. The Permabull frames the RSI at 27.74 as a 'capitulation setup for sharp rebound,' but this ignores that deeply oversold conditions can persist in structural downtrends (price 14.2% below 200-day SMA). The bearish double-top pattern targeting $255 via 61.8% Fibonacci and the RANGE_BOUND regime at 283.30 with only 1.71% 5-day volatility (MODERATE) show NO conviction for upside. The market is not 'coiling'—it is consolidating losses while awaiting the Brazilian crop deluge.

**4. Brazilian Real Strength Creates 'Shadow Supply' Overhang, Not Bullish Withholding (Neutral/Bear Wins on Logic):** The Macro Report documents BRL at a 1.75-year high (USD/BRL 5.1258, +1.07% monthly) with Selic at 15.00%, causing farmer reluctance (soybean sales 36% vs 44% prior year). The Permabull argues this 'amplifies bullish withholding without liquidation pressure,' but the Macro Report explicitly warns this creates 'shadow supply' that 'will eventually need to be liquidated, likely capping price upside once exchange rates stabilize or cash flow needs force selling.' The withheld inventory is not destroyed—it is deferred selling pressure. With 66.2 million bags of record production arriving, farmers cannot indefinitely hold inventory against carrying costs and working capital needs. This is a bearish overhang, not a bullish constraint.

**Decision Framework Application:** The 24h change is -0.53% (Feb 26 at 282.89), not triggering the <-1.5% technical liquidation threshold, but the cumulative 14.2% decline below the 200-day SMA and proximity to 15-month lows signals an established downtrend. The 'Priced In' check does not apply (no >3% rally). Hegelian synthesis: The Bear's structural oversupply thesis (record crop + clearing bottlenecks + spec capitulation) defeats the Bull's transient bottleneck argument, which relies on stale December/January data. Evidence counting: Bear has 5/7 specialist reports vs. Bull's 1/7 (Supply Chain), with Macro/Volatility neutral. The Volatility Report's technical error and 0.55 confidence NEUTRAL tag provides no basis to upgrade thesis strength, reinforcing PLAUSIBLE over PROVEN.

**Consensus Mechanism Validation:** The dominant agent is supply_chain (BULLISH), creating tension with the -0.206 weighted score. However, examining the supply_chain evidence reveals it focuses on January export data (-30.8%) and December delays (486,300 bags), which are backward-looking relative to the February Port of Santos record throughput. The geopolitical, inventory, sentiment, and technical reports all incorporate more recent data showing resolution. I override the dominant agent because its evidence is stale relative to the clearing trend documented by four independent specialist reports. [DA VETO: SCENARIO 1 - Brazilian Real Collapse Triggers Export Flood: The BRL strengthening to 1.75-year highs has created a 'shadow supply' of 66.2M bags held by farmers. If the Selic rate cuts materialize faster than expected (market pricing 200bps of cuts in 2026) or if commodity prices globally rally, the USD/BRL could reverse violently to 5.50+, making exports suddenly profitable. This would release the pent-up inventory in a coordinated selling wave, overwhelming the market within 48-72 hours. We dismissed this tail risk by treating the BRL strength as static 'bearish overhang' rather than recognizing it as a binary trigger—the longer farmers hold, the more violent the eventual liquidation when currency or cash flow pressure forces their hand.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 3.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.4, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.19, ""contribution"": -0.95}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.56, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.3, ""final_weight"": 0.56, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.57, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.3, ""final_weight"": 0.28, ""contribution"": -0.226}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.36, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.3, ""final_weight"": 2.03, ""contribution"": 1.626}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.48, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.3, ""final_weight"": 0.72, ""contribution"": -0.468}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.5, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.3, ""final_weight"": 0.5, ""contribution"": -0.4}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.68, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.3, ""final_weight"": 1.54, ""contribution"": -1.231}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.55, ""domain_weight"": 1.4, ""reliability_mult"": 0.84, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.3, ""final_weight"": 1.17, ""contribution"": 0.0}]",supply_chain,0.0,WeatherSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,"Structural supply expansion from record Brazilian crop (66.2 million bags, +17.2% YoY) converging with clearing logistics bottlenecks at Port of Santos (12.7M tonnes record throughput, +9.5% YoY), creating oversupply pressure that the current RANGE_BOUND regime at 283.30 (14.2% below 200-day SMA) reflects as baseline pricing.",1.0,"The Permabull's strongest counter-argument is the Supply Chain Report documenting January exports down 30.8% YoY with 486,300 bags delayed at Santos, creating 'immediate supply shock' and physical bottleneck that 'cannot reach the market.' This is overridden because: (1) The bottleneck data is from December 2025/January 2026, while February 2026 Port of Santos achieved RECORD throughput of 12.7M tonnes (+9.5% YoY), demonstrating the obstruction is clearing; (2) The Inventory Report shows ICE certified stocks RISING to 455,420 bags with 171,080 pending grading, proving deliverable supply is accumulating despite the bottleneck; (3) The -2% futures drop on EUDR delay (Feb 20) confirms the market is pricing supply relief, not sustained tightness. The transient bottleneck cannot outweigh the convergence of record Brazilian production (66.2 million bags), clearing logistics, rising exchange stocks, and spec capitulation into a RANGE_BOUND regime 14.2% below the 200-day SMA. The Bear's structural oversupply thesis is supported by more recent, multi-source evidence."
