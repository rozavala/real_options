=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8
[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",NEUTRAL,0.52,"The Bull has the stronger *catalyst* (the WeatherSentinel drought: 0.0mm in the Central Highlands at the FLOWERING stage, severity 9/10), which is exactly the kind of timing-sensitive stress that can translate into real yield/quality losses and an asymmetric upside risk if confirmed in a major arabica-producing area. The Bull also adds a second, independent supportive line: Brazil export flow disruption (Jan exports sharply down YoY) plus Santos bottlenecks, arguing that physical availability can stay tight even if global freight indices soften.

However, the Bear is more grounded in the *current market datapoints that directly map to deliverable supply and structure*: ICE-certified stocks are rising (modestly) and, more importantly, bags pending grading jumped materially—an exchange-pipeline signal that can turn into larger certified builds. At the same time, the nearby spread has collapsed toward flat, which is consistent with the market removing urgency for prompt supply. Those are immediate, market-implied indicators that the “tight nearby” story is weakening in real time.

On trend discipline, the Bear also has a valid point: price remains well below the 200-day SMA in a TRENDING regime, which argues against treating a small bounce/RSI stabilization as proof of a durable reversal. The Bull’s technical rebuttal (oversold/short-covering, waning downside momentum) supports only a tactical bounce risk, not an outright trend change.

Applying the decision framework: there is no 24h crash signal provided that forces a liquidation assumption, and the drought is a legitimate new-weather-shock that must be respected. But the drought’s price impact is not yet corroborated by the most coffee-specific, high-signal market internals (spreads/inventory trajectory), which are currently leaning bearish. Evidence counting yields a true split: (1) weather shock + (2) Brazil export bottlenecks support upside risk, while (1) pending grading surge + (2) collapsing spread + (3) below-200DMA trend support downside/containment. With this push-pull, the most data-grounded verdict is NEUTRAL with a weather-driven upside tail rather than a clean bullish or bearish call.

I do not dismiss it; it is why the verdict is not BULLISH. I override it only to the extent of staying NEUTRAL (not BEARISH) because the Central Highlands drought at flowering is a high-severity, timing-critical shock that can rapidly invalidate forward surplus narratives if it hits a meaningful producing base and begins to show up in quality/yield reports."
