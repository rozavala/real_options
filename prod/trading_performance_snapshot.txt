=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
3. **TECHNICAL SUPPORT IS A BULL TRAP IN CONTEXT**: The Bull leans on RSI divergence at 280 and 'cheap IV' as mean-reversion signals. However, Market Data shows a RANGE_BOUND regime with MODERATE 5-day volatility (1.78%)—not a volatile reversal setup. Price is 14.8% below the 200-day SMA, confirming entrenched bearish momentum. The Agronomist's data on 330mm rain (85% above average) validates Conab's record harvest forecast, while the Inventory Report's bearish sentiment (0.8 confidence) reinforces oversupply. Support levels fail when fundamental reality (record crop, easing logistics, farmer selling pressure) overwhelms technicals. The 280 level is distribution, not accumulation.

**CRITICAL DECISION FRAMEWORK APPLICATION**:
- **RESPECT THE TREND (Rule 1)**: 24h change is -0.53% (not < -1.5%), but the monthly -22.97% decline establishes a clear bearish trend. The Bull's 'dip-buying' thesis lacks a New Weather Shock to override this momentum.
- **EVIDENCE COUNTING (Rule 4)**: Five independent desks (Agronomist, Inventory, Technical, Sentiment, Macro) converge on bearish or neutral views, vs. two bullish outliers (Supply Chain, Volatility). The Bear's synthesis integrates more data streams.
- **VOLATILITY COST AWARENESS (Rule 5)**: The Volatility Analyst's 'cheap IV' call is bullish, but this does NOT meet the 'overwhelming evidence' threshold to override the convergent bearish signals. Per Rule 5, I downgrade from PROVEN to PLAUSIBLE.

**XSENTIMENTSENTINEL TRIGGER ANALYSIS**: The 19-post volume spike (vs 4.8 baseline) with top themes 'Price declines and futures dropping' and 'Abundant Brazilian supply pressuring prices' directly corroborates the bearish thesis. While overall confidence is low (0.31), the 'arabica prices' query scored 3.0 with 6 posts at 0.7 confidence, and the specific post on 'calendar spread inversion easing' provides actionable signal. The Bear correctly interprets this as market anticipation of supply normalization.

**VERDICT**: The Bear wins on superior integration of forward-looking indicators (freight easing, pending inventory, FX policy shift) vs. the Bull's reliance on backward-looking bottleneck data. The thesis strength is PLAUSIBLE (not PROVEN) due to acknowledged tail risks: logistics could persist longer than freight data suggests, and backwardation (Mar 2026 @ 281.15 vs Mar 2028 @ 244.95) indicates residual physical tightness that could trigger short-covering rallies. However, the preponderance of evidence supports continued downside pressure as Brazil's record harvest meets farmer selling into weakening BRL. [DA VETO: BACKWARDATION SQUEEZE SCENARIO: We catastrophically underestimated the 'physical tightness vs paper oversupply' divergence. The Mar 2026 @ 281.15 vs Mar 2028 @ 244.95 backwardation signaled spot market stress that our fundamental analysis dismissed as 'residual'. When logistics didn't normalize as predicted (AccuWeather clearing forecast proved wrong, Santos yard utilization spiked to 85%+ due to competing soy exports), the 602k bags/month trapped supply became a structural bottleneck, not temporary friction. Short sellers covering into zero physical availability triggered a +40% squeeze in 72 hours. We confused 'pending grading' inventory (+7,395 bags) with 'available' inventory - those bags were already pre-sold or quality-rejected, creating phantom supply on our models.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.4, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.56, ""contribution"": -0.449}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.56, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.79, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.57, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.8, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.36, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 1.92, ""contribution"": 1.537}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.48, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.68, ""contribution"": -0.544}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.5, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 0.75, ""contribution"": -0.6}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.68, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 1.45, ""contribution"": -1.164}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.0499999999999998, ""reliability_mult"": 0.84, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.83, ""contribution"": 0.539}]",supply_chain,0.0,XSentimentSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,"Convergence of record Brazilian harvest (66.2M bags, +17.2% YoY) with imminent farmer inventory release as Central Bank easing cycle weakens BRL, overwhelming temporary logistics friction",1.0,"The Bull's strongest argument is that 55% vessel delays trapping 602k bags/month represent a 'hard supply constraint' creating immediate physical tightness, validated by persistent backwardation. I override this because: (1) the Containerized Freight Index decline (-14.16%) and Pending Grading surge (+7,395 bags) indicate the constraint is temporary and already reversing; (2) the XSentimentSentinel post on 'calendar spread inversion easing' (0.7 confidence) confirms the market is pricing normalization, not scarcity; (3) the record harvest (66.2M bags) and imminent farmer selling (triggered by Selic cuts weakening BRL) create overwhelming supply that will flood through any logistics friction within 4-8 weeks. The bottleneck is a decaying variable; the supply surge is structural."
