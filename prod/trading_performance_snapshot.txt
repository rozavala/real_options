=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

The Bull's supply-chain bottleneck thesis is contradicted by freight market evidence. The Geopolitical Report shows the Drewry World Container Index declining for six consecutive weeks to $1,919/40ft (-1% WoW) and Far East-US East Coast rates at $2,688/container. If Santos port congestion were binding, container rates would rise, not fall. The Inventory Report confirms ICE certified stocks climbed to 453,612 bags, with the analyst explicitly stating 'logistical bottlenecks are easing and high prices are attracting deliverable supply.' The removal of US tariffs on Brazilian goods (Feb 23 Supreme Court ruling) is tactically bullish for demand recovery but strategically bearish—it accelerates the flow of Brazil's record crop into the US market.

Technical positioning supports mean-reversion risk but not sustained bullish reversal. The Technical Report documents RSI ~31 (oversold) and bullish Stochastic divergence near 280¢, yet concludes with 'mildly bearish bias' and projects a choppy 250-285¢ range. Current price at 285.00 sits at the top of this range, offering poor risk-reward for longs. The Sentiment Report shows speculative capitulation: the rally to $4.41/lb ATH 'failed to attract additional speculative demand, with both long and short positions being reduced.' This is profit-taking exhaustion, not accumulation. Market Data confirms the 24h price change is not significantly negative (< -1.5%), so RESPECT THE TREND does not trigger a technical liquidation override, but the 13.8% position below the 200-day SMA (330.55) and RANGE_BOUND regime confirm no bullish momentum.

The Inventory Report's revised 'MODERATE BEARISH' tag (0.65 confidence) is the tiebreaker: 'The convergence of a record Brazilian crop forecast and rising global exports confirms a structural shift from deficit to surplus... the bearish fundamental weight of the incoming 66.2M bag crop overrides the technical backwardation.' The forward curve's backwardation is a lagging indicator of past tightness, not a leading indicator of future supply.

Evidence counting: The Bear assembles four independent bearish signals—(1) Brazil crop surplus, (2) export collapse indicating demand/supply imbalance, (3) easing freight costs disproving bottleneck thesis, (4) speculative capitulation and technical downtrend. The Bull's case rests on (1) tactical BRL withholding (unproven for coffee specifically), (2) minor Colombian weather noise (false positive), and (3) technical oversold bounce potential (already reflected in 285.00 price at range top). The Bear's argument is grounded in hard supply/export data; the Bull's relies on extrapolation and analogy. The weighted voting consensus was BEARISH with 0.59 confidence and -0.223 weighted score, dominated by the Agronomist.

Volatility caveat: The Volatility Report failed (system error), so IV data is unavailable. Under normal conditions, Decision Framework Rule 5 would require downgrading thesis_strength if options were expensive. Given moderate 5-day realized volatility (1.70%) and no panic premium despite the weather alert, implied volatility is likely not elevated. However, the absence of data introduces uncertainty—thesis_strength is set to PLAUSIBLE (one strong supply signal + corroborating export/freight data) rather than PROVEN, respecting the unknown IV positioning and the Bull's valid mean-reversion technical setup. [DA VETO: SCENARIO 1 - BRL Withholding Triggers Short Squeeze: The Macro Report's 'weak analogy' caveat was prophetic—we dismissed the BRL appreciation mechanism because soybean data isn't coffee-specific, but Brazilian coffee farmers ARE withholding aggressively. The 30.8% January export collapse wasn't demand weakness; it was strategic retention ahead of the May-July harvest. With Selic at 15%, farmers are leveraging warehouse receipts as collateral rather than selling into a weak BRL. By day 5, Santos congestion (187 ships, 73 arrivals/24h) creates a physical squeeze: ICE stocks fall from 453k bags toward 300k as roasters scramble for April delivery. The Bull's 'technically bullish local factors' (Colombia rain disruptions + Vietnam tail risks) compound into a 15% rally to 328¢. We were bearish at the TOP of the consolidation range (285¢) and got stopped out as RSI divergence played out exactly as the Technical Report warned.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 3.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.73, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 2.2, ""contribution"": -1.759}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.6, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.6, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.61, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.31, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.22, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 1.83, ""contribution"": 1.465}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.61, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.91, ""contribution"": -0.594}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.71, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.71, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.85, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 1.9, ""contribution"": -1.236}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.55, ""domain_weight"": 1.4, ""reliability_mult"": 0.78, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 1.09, ""contribution"": 0.0}]",agronomist,0.0,WeatherSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,Brazil's record 2026 harvest forecast of 66.2M bags (+17.2% YoY) creating structural supply surplus that overwhelms tactical BRL-driven farmer withholding and localized Colombian weather friction,1.0,"The Bull's strongest counter-argument is that BRL appreciation (USD/BRL 5.1532, +2.42% monthly) mechanically reduces farmer selling incentives, replicating the 10pp below-average soybean sales pattern, and that oversold technicals (RSI 31, bullish divergence at 280¢) in a RANGE_BOUND regime (price 285.00 vs 330.55 SMA) create attractive mean-reversion upside. I override this because: (1) The Macro Report itself flags the soybean analogy as 'weak' with no coffee-specific commercialization data, assigning only NEUTRAL/0.65 confidence. (2) January exports already collapsed 30.8% YoY—if this is withholding, it's unsustainable against 15% Selic and 66.2M bag harvest pressure; if it's demand weakness, it's bearish. (3) Oversold conditions justify a tactical bounce within the 250-285¢ range, but current price at 285.00 sits at the range top with no margin of safety. (4) The Inventory Report explicitly states the 'bearish fundamental weight of the incoming crop overrides technical backwardation,' confirming the structural bear case trumps cyclical positioning. The Bull's thesis is tactically plausible for a short-covering rally but strategically uncompelling against the supply tsunami arriving in Q2-Q3 2026."
