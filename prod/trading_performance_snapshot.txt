=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

Respect-the-trend check: there is no reported 24h crash trigger (< -1.5%) in the packet, but the broader trend evidence is clearly down (large monthly drawdown; price far below the 200-day; trend-following signals still negative). That makes “buy the dip” logic less justified absent a dominating new weather shock—which is not present. The agronomist’s weather discussion is actually supply-positive near term (dryness aiding harvest logistics and export flow in Honduras), which is bearish, not bullish.

On the debate’s key crux—near-term tightness vs. supply cycle—the bull leans heavily on backwardation plus the Brazil export drop to argue a squeeze. But the packet’s own inventory and volatility notes frame backwardation as compatible with a transition phase where nearby tightness is easing (certified stocks rising) while the market prices future abundance. The export drop is real, yet the bull’s interpretation (bullish tightness) is less supported than the bear’s alternative (upstream retention/flow timing that can reverse), because there’s no hard evidence in the packet that demand is surging or that a true supply disruption is occurring.

Mandatory trigger (Unusual X activity spike): the spike is acknowledged but is low-confidence and internally weak for KC/Arabica specifically (confidence is low; targeted Arabica/KC queries show zero volume; top themes skew to Robusta/Nigeria). The one potentially bullish theme (“Brazil harvest delays”) is not substantiated elsewhere in the provided reports with hard, contemporaneous disruption data. Net: the X spike is more noise than signal and does not outweigh the multiple concrete bearish datapoints.

Evidence counting favors the bear: technicals, inventory, macro, geopolitics, sentiment, and volatility reports all independently lean bearish for different reasons; only the supply-chain report is cleanly bullish, and even that report concedes the export drop is unlikely due to logistics. Given this multi-source convergence, the bear’s case is better supported by the current dataset.

Volatility-cost awareness: IV is N/A, so there is no explicit “options are expensive” downgrade trigger. Still, the market has shown meaningful recent movement (large monthly decline), so the correct posture is bearish but not maximal conviction—hence PLAUSIBLE rather than PROVEN. [DA VETO: BACKWARDATION SQUEEZE TRAP: The futures curve is in backwardation (CocoaIntel, Feb 19), signaling immediate commercial tightness that we dismissed as 'transitional.' If the 30.8% Brazil export collapse (Cecafé) reflects upstream retention or logistical bottlenecks rather than weak demand, certified stocks rising by only 9,638 bags to 449,566 (StoneX) may be insufficient to meet March delivery obligations. A squeeze into KCK6 expiry could force prices 15-20% higher in 72 hours, destroying a bearish position before the 'record crop' narrative even matters for spot supply.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.96, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.5, ""final_weight"": 1.44, ""contribution"": -1.154}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.97, ""contribution"": -0.629}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.97, ""contribution"": -0.633}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.96, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.9, ""final_weight"": 1.43, ""contribution"": 1.148}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.81, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.9, ""final_weight"": 1.21, ""contribution"": -0.966}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.75, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.13, ""contribution"": -0.732}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.9, ""final_weight"": 2.1, ""contribution"": -1.365}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0499999999999998, ""reliability_mult"": 0.74, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.78, ""contribution"": -0.623}]",technical,0.0,XSentimentSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,Evidence of improving deliverable availability and a larger Brazil supply outlook (rising ICE-certified stocks alongside Conab/StoneX higher 2026 production projections) reinforcing an already-established downtrend.,1.0,"The strongest bull counter is the combination of backwardation plus the sharp Brazil export decline, which can signal near-term physical tightness and a squeeze/short-covering rally given RSI near-oversold.
