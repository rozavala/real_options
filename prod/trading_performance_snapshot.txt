=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
[ANALYSIS]: Critique of prior view: (1) Logical consistency – the earlier note implicitly equated a decline below moving averages with a ‘firmly established down-trend’ without testing the medium-term price structure (e.g., higher-time-frame lows still reside above late-2025 swing lows near 250 ¢). That may overstate bearishness (confirmation bias). (2) Causation – assuming that price weakness is entirely due to record Brazilian supply ignores demand variables (roaster coverage, discretionary consumption) and weather-driven quality concerns; that is a potential post-hoc fallacy. (3) Evidence – technical data were properly cited; the Brazilian-crop claim, however, relied on a single article and lacked corroboration. (4) Sentiment tag – BEARISH was defensible on short-term momentum, but the language ‘firmly established’ was too strong given RSI not yet oversold and support only 0.7 % below spot.  

Revised view: Coffee is below both its 50- and 200-day SMAs and the RSI sits at 36, signalling short-term negative momentum. However, the market is only 12 % under its 200-day average, not an extreme discount, and open-interest data (ICE) show funds already net-short 8 k lots versus a five-year average net-long of 12 k, suggesting a fair amount of bearish positioning is priced in. Fundamental news continues to emphasise a potentially record 2024/25 Brazilian crop, but CONAB and private forecasters still warn about flowering losses in Minas Gerais; therefore supply risk is skewed but not certain. Immediate price inflection levels are 291 ¢ (S1) and 286 ¢ (S3). A decisive close below 286 ¢ would complete a three-week descending triangle and could accelerate liquidations toward 275 ¢ (Nov-2025 low). Conversely, any rally through 300 ¢/lb would place the contract back above the January breakdown zone and force short-covering toward the 50-day average near 308 ¢.  

Net assessment: Short-term bias remains mildly BEARISH while price sits beneath 300 ¢ and supply headlines dominate, but the proximity of support and already-elevated speculative shorts limit conviction. Traders might favour selling rallies to 297-300 ¢ rather than pressing new shorts at current levels, and should monitor Brazilian weather updates for validation.

[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",BEARISH,"[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-17] Coffee May '26 futures (KCK6) trading ~286.03 cents/lb (-4% daily, -20% monthly). [2026-02-17] 20-Day HV is ~29.47%. [2026-02-11] IV observed in 40-50% range (significantly > HV). [2026-02-05] Conab projects record Brazil production (66.2m bags, +17.2% YoY).
[ANALYSIS]: The market is confirmed to be in a High Volatility regime, defined by the substantial spread between Implied Volatility (~51%) and 20-Day Historical Volatility (~29.5%). This discrepancy indicates that option premiums are overpriced relative to recent actual price movement, favoring net-credit strategies. Fundamentally, the bearish sentiment is robust, driven by the Conab report of a record Brazilian crop, which correlates with the ~20% price decline over the past month. While the market is technically oversold, the inflated IV makes buying puts capital-inefficient. A Bear Call Spread remains the superior strategy to monetize the high IV rank while maintaining a bearish directional bias.

[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",NEUTRAL,0.0,"BLOCKED BY COMPLIANCE: (1) Hallucination / unsupported specificity: The decision states the -4.74% 24h move 'meets the framework’s “assume Technical Liquidation” threshold.' No report or evidence packet defines such a threshold or framework rule, so this is an uncited rule/assertion. (2) Minor internal inconsistency: It cites May-26 price action as -4.74% (Market Context) but elsewhere in the packet Technical has May-26 at -0.98% d/d and Volatility has ~-4%; not fatal, but the reasoning should clarify which contract/print it is anchoring to. (3) No critical-risk omission detected: bounce/mean-reversion risk from oversold/positioning is acknowledged; logistics-causality caveat is incorporated; IV-expensive options noted.
