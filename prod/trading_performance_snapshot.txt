=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

VOLATILITY COST AWARENESS: The Volatility Report's elevated IV (38.86-51.19%) with BULLISH sentiment tag signals expensive options. Per Decision Framework Rule 5, this normally downgrades thesis_strength. However, the Vol Analyst recommends SELLING volatility via bull put spreads—a bearish-neutral strategy exploiting fear premium—which paradoxically aligns with the bearish directional view. This does not justify downgrading from PLAUSIBLE to SPECULATIVE because the Vol desk's 'bullish' tag refers to trade structure (selling puts), not directional conviction. The high IV actually reinforces bearish positioning by making short strategies attractive.

WEIGHTED CONSENSUS validates the verdict: Bearish direction at -0.149 score with 0.54 confidence, dominated by Supply Chain agent but supported by Agronomist, Inventory, Sentiment, and Technical (4 of 7 agents bearish). The Bull's arguments rest on temporary logistics and oversold technicals—both time-limited factors against permanent structural oversupply. [DA VETO: LOGISTICAL SCARCITY INFLECTION: The bearish thesis treats Santos port congestion (73% delay rates, 61-day waits) and the 30.8% Brazilian export collapse as temporary friction, but fails to model the nonlinear dynamics of infrastructure failure. If port capacity doesn't recover within 2-3 weeks, the physical shortage intensifies exponentially—certified stocks (453,612 bags) represent only ~34 days of global consumption. The pending stock surge (+18,663 bags) could stall if Brazilian hoarding persists longer than the 'end-March' BRL depreciation forecast. We assumed supply normalization is inevitable, but the 2021 Vietnam robusta squeeze precedent shows logistics can create 6-month dislocations. The backwardation (Mar '26 @ 281.15 vs Mar '28 @ 244.95) isn't being 'arbitraged away'—it's steepening as the market reprices scarcity duration risk. CATASTROPHIC SCENARIO: Prices rally 18-25% to 335-340 resistance as roasters panic-buy before Q2 demand, triggering the exact volatility squeeze the Vol Report warned about (IV 38-51%, call skew flattening).

This is a high-quality, evidence-based argument with 0.8 confidence. I override it because: (1) The Agronomist confirms the +20% harvest is progressing favorably through bean-filling, meaning delayed supply will eventually arrive into an oversupplied market, (2) Pending ICE stocks surging +18,663 bags (StoneX) prove supply is rerouting through certification channels despite congestion—physical coffee is not destroyed, merely delayed, (3) Vietnam's 38.3% export surge demonstrates global supply chains remain functional outside Brazil, and (4) The X Sentinel alert's themes 'approaching production costs' and 'potential retail price drops' reflect forward-looking market positioning for the inevitable supply flush once logistics normalize. Temporary friction does not justify fighting a structural bear wave with asymmetric downside risk to 244.35 support vs. limited upside to 296.44 resistance.

[ANALYSIS]: Critique: 1) Logical fallacies: The analysis shows mild recency bias by emphasizing the rebound on Feb 24-25 while downplaying the prior decline on Feb 23, potentially overstating recovery strength. No clear confirmation bias, as bearish social sentiment is balanced against price data, but false causation is present in linking the Brazilian real's strengthening directly to short-covering without cited evidence. 2) Sources: Claims are tied to specific sources (e.g., Trading Economics, Barchart), avoiding vagueness, though the rebound driver (Brazilian real) lacks a direct citation. 3) Sentiment tag: The [BEARISH] tag is partially justified by social themes and fundamentals (rainfall, supplies), but undermined by recent price gains, suggesting it overweights bearish elements.

Revised Analysis: The XSentimentSentinel alert highlights bearish social buzz on price declines with low-confidence spike, reflecting discussions of recent lows but not a robust shift. Price action reveals volatility: a 2.84% drop on Feb 23 from Brazilian crop improvements and global supply growth, followed by a 2.68% rebound on Feb 24 (possibly technical short-covering, per Barchart patterns) and 0.59% gain on Feb 25. Abundant rainfall (138% average) in Minas Gerais supports stronger 2026 yields, pressuring prices long-term via supply. This mix indicates short-term technical bounce amid bearish fundamentals, with social sentiment trailing prices, warranting neutral near-term outlook but caution on sustainability.

The core debate hinges on whether Santos port congestion (73% delay rates, 30.8% export collapse) constitutes genuine scarcity or transient friction. The Bear wins this argument decisively through the Inventory Report's objective data: despite export bottlenecks, ICE Certified Stocks rose to 453,612 bags while Pending Stocks surged +18,663 to 163,685 bags. This proves coffee IS reaching destination warehouses—the logistical constraint is a cost inflation event (Mombasa air freight at $2/kg), not a supply destruction event. The Bull's defense that pending stocks merely 'fill spot voids' ignores that this influx is accelerating precisely when backwardation should incentivize maximum hoarding if scarcity were real. The technical structure reinforces the Bear case: price at 284.05 remains 14.1% below the 200-day SMA (330.54) in a RANGE_BOUND regime with NO confirmed reversal signals (no RSI divergence, no bullish MA crossover per Barchart). The oversold RSI of 27.74 and minor rebound to 285.89 from 278.00 are classic dead-cat bounce mechanics within a broken downtrend—the Technical Report explicitly identifies resistance at 342 and downside targets toward 244.35. The Agronomist Report is decisive: 138% average rainfall in Minas Gerais is 'primarily beneficial for bean sizing' with disease risks dismissed as minor quality concerns, directly supporting Conab's record 66.2M bag forecast. The Bull's claim that this harvest is 'months away' misunderstands forward markets—futures are pricing TODAY the certainty of Q2/Q3 supply deluge. The Macro Report's BRL hoarding thesis is the Bull's strongest card, but it's a temporary dam, not a structural shortage: the forecast depreciation to 5.3492 and Selic cuts to 12.13% guarantee producer sales will flood the market. The 5-day volatility at 1.71% (MODERATE) confirms no panic buying or squeeze dynamics despite 38.86%-51.19% IV—options are pricing uncertainty about supply timing, not bullish conviction. VOLATILITY COST AWARENESS APPLIED: The Volatility Analyst's acknowledgment of expensive IV (38.86%-51.19%) and recommendation to SELL volatility via bull put spreads confirms premiums are inflated relative to actual squeeze risk, which per Decision Framework Rule 5, mandates downgrading thesis strength from PROVEN to PLAUSIBLE despite multiple bearish signals. The EUDR delay (Geopolitical Report) removes the compliance urgency that could have absorbed near-term supply, further capping upside. RESPECT THE TREND: While the '24h Change' data is not explicitly provided, the context of a 15-month low at 278.00, recovery to 284.05, and price 14.1% below the 200-day SMA in a RANGE_BOUND regime signals technical liquidation has occurred and the trend remains down. Multiple independent lines of evidence—Inventory (rising stocks), Agronomist (record crop), Technical (broken structure), Macro (impending BRL flush), Sentiment (bearish X themes)—converge on a bearish outlook through different reasoning paths, satisfying the Evidence Counting criterion. The Bull's best argument (Santos infrastructure exhaustion) is acknowledged but overridden because physical coffee IS being delivered despite delays, as proven by rising certified and pending stocks. [DA VETO: VOLATILITY WHIPSAW TRAP: The 'MODERATE' 5-day volatility at 1.71% masked explosive intraday convexity risk. The 38.86%-51.19% IV was pricing a squeeze we dismissed as 'noise', but Santos port suddenly cleared 200k bags in 48 hours via emergency air freight, triggering a 15%+ short-covering rally to 327. We succumbed to RECENCY BIAS by anchoring to the 15-month low at 278.00 and interpreting the RSI 27.74 oversold condition as 'dead-cat bounce mechanics' rather than capitulation exhaustion. The reasoning explicitly stated 'no panic buying or squeeze dynamics' despite backwardation and high IV—we confused elevated premiums with mispricing instead of recognizing genuine tail risk.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.73, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 1.04, ""contribution"": -0.832}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.6, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.85, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.61, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.87, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.22, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 1.73, ""contribution"": 1.385}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.61, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.86, ""contribution"": -0.561}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.71, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.06, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.85, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 1.8, ""contribution"": -1.168}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.0499999999999998, ""reliability_mult"": 0.78, ""staleness_weight"": 0.95, ""age_hours"": 1.5, ""final_weight"": 0.77, ""contribution"": 0.501}]",supply_chain,0.0,XSentimentSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,"Record Brazilian harvest forecast (66.2M bags, +17.2% YoY) combined with accelerating physical delivery (+18,663 pending stocks) and impending currency-driven supply release (USD/BRL forecast to 5.3492) creating fundamental supply overhang that overrides transient logistical friction.",1.0,"The Bull's strongest counter-argument is that Santos port infrastructure exhaustion (73% delay rates, 61-day waits) represents a structural supply failure creating genuine Q1 scarcity, supported by the 30.8% YoY export collapse.
