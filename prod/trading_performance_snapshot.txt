=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
1️⃣ Logical gaps – The original argument implicitly assumes that supply growth will instantly pressure nearby futures, ignoring lag times between harvest, export flow, and warehouse stocks. It also treats the 200-day SMA breach as proof of a continuing down-trend without evaluating trend-strength indicators (e.g., ADX) or longer-term chart structure (higher-highs / higher-lows conflicts). 2️⃣ Evidence use – All claims were source-linked, but the discussion of ‘no evidence of sustained demand’ lacked data on certified stocks, roaster buying or COT positioning. 3️⃣ Sentiment tag – While generally defensible, it did not acknowledge oversold conditions and potential weather risks that can spark sharp rallies in coffee, so the outright BEARISH tag may have been too one-sided.

Revised analysis: Price remains 15 % below its 200-day SMA, confirming that longer-term momentum is negative, yet the slope of that average has flattened, hinting the down-trend is losing force. The recent rebound from 259 ¢/lb to 272 ¢/lb occurred on higher volume and pushed the daily RSI out of sub-30 territory, suggesting some short-term exhaustion of selling pressure. Nonetheless, to flip the trend, bulls would have to close the market above layered resistance at 274 ¢/lb and then 285 ¢/lb (December breakdown level). On the fundamental side, Conab’s projected record Brazilian crop expands 2026 global supply by roughly 6 million bags, offsetting only modest demand growth of ~2 % and capping upside until clearer weather threats or demand surprises emerge. ICE certified arabica stocks have stabilised near 490 k bags after months of drawdowns, removing a key bullish narrative from 2024-25. Offsetting factors include El Niño-linked rainfall variability in Brazil’s main arabica regions and a recent uptick in non-commercial net-short positions, which could spark a covering rally if key resistances are breached.

Bottom line: The macro-trend is still down, but momentum indicators and positioning warn of two-way risk. Traders should treat 268 ¢/lb as pivotal short-term support; a decisive break below re-opens 250 ¢/lb, while closes above 285 ¢/lb would neutralise the bearish bias.

[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",BEARISH,"[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-18] Brazil's Conab projected a record 2026 coffee crop of 66.2 million bags, a 17.2% year-on-year increase, with Arabica output expected to rise 23.2%. [2026-02-18] Minas Gerais received 72.6 mm of rain (113% of the historical average), improving the 2026 crop outlook. [2026-02-19] The U.S. Dollar strength following the FOMC minutes release was cited as a primary factor weighing on sugar and coffee prices. [2026-02-19] March Arabica coffee (KCH26) closed at 287.95 cents/lb, marking a 15-month low amid a 17.42% decline over the past month.
[ANALYSIS]: The market outlook remains structurally bearish as powerful fundamental supply drivers align with macroeconomic headwinds. The core thesis rests on the transition from scarcity to surplus, evidenced by Conab's projection of a record 2026 crop with a specific 23.2% surge in Arabica production. This forecast is physically validated by real-time weather data showing rainfall in Minas Gerais at 113% of the historical average, negating weather-risk premiums. Macroeconomically, the strengthening U.S. Dollar following the FOMC minutes acts as a force multiplier for the sell-off. While the 17.42% monthly decline to a 15-month low of 287.95 cents/lb indicates the market is rapidly pricing in this surplus, the alignment of record production estimates with currency pressure suggests the downward trend is fundamental rather than merely technical.
[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8
[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",NEUTRAL,0.0,"Bear has the more data-grounded case in the current packet. Multiple independent reports converge on the same core driver: a Brazil-led supply expansion narrative (Conab record crop forecast; Arabica output projected sharply higher) reinforced by supportive Brazil weather (Minas Gerais rainfall above average) and corroborated by market behavior (15‑month lows, price well below the 200‑day SMA, rebounds described as short-covering/bottom-fishing rather than new fundamental buying). In addition, the URGENT TRIGGER matters: the May 22 FOMC minutes hawkish pivot implies higher-for-longer and USD support; the desk evidence repeatedly frames this as a headwind for USD-priced commodities. The bull’s rebuttal leans on near-term tightness signals (export drop, port delays, backwardation) but these are either short-horizon frictions or weaker in face of rising ICE-certified stocks and the dominant forward supply outlook; they do not rise to an “overwhelming weather shock” that would justify fading a broadly bearish tape. Trend respect: the contract is materially below the 200-day SMA and recent lows were severe; that aligns with the consensus bearish vote and argues against treating the discount as an ‘entry’ without a stronger shock catalyst. Evidence counting favors Bear: macro headwind (hawkish pivot) + supply outlook (Conab) + validating weather + rising certified stocks + technical downtrend all point the same way, while the bull mainly argues timing/positioning and localized logistics. [DA VETO: CROWDED SHORT TRAP: The 15-month low, 28% YoY decline, and explicit 'short-covering' attribution signal a heavily positioned bearish market. When every agent cites the same Conab record-crop forecast and all reach identical BEARISH conclusions, we are trading consensus, not edge. The catastrophic failure scenario: a weather shock (frost, drought during bean-fill stage in Brazil's June-August window) or Vietnam heat-stress materialization triggers a violent short squeeze from 285¢/lb back above 320¢/lb resistance within 5 days, vaporizing positions sized for trend continuation.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.9, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 0.45, ""contribution"": 0.36}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 3.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.94, ""contribution"": -1.259}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.65, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.3, ""contribution"": -0.844}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 1.02, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 1.02, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.85, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 0.43, ""contribution"": -0.341}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.0, ""reliability_mult"": 0.71, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.42, ""contribution"": -0.921}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.89, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.4, ""final_weight"": 2.01, ""contribution"": -1.303}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.4, ""reliability_mult"": 0.74, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.04, ""contribution"": -0.831}]",technical,0.0,MacroContagionSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,"Brazil’s record-crop supply outlook (Conab) validated by favorable Minas Gerais rainfall, shifting the balance toward surplus as the market trades below long-term trend.",1.0,"Near-term tightness/spot squeeze signals (export drop, Santos delays, backwardation, potential short-covering) could drive sharp counter-trend rallies; I override because rising ICE-certified stocks and the dominant forward supply narrative, combined with the hawkish-Fed/USD headwind, are better supported and more consequential for the current pricing regime than temporary logistics frictions."
