=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
[ANALYSIS]: Trend indicators remain negative: KCU6 is 3–4 % under both its 50- and 200-day SMAs and has just registered a bearish MACD crossover. Historically, Arabica closes beneath the 200-day average have led to further downside on roughly 70 % of occasions over the past five years. Fundamentally, CONAB’s record 66.2 M-bag Brazilian crop could shift the 2026/27 global balance from a small deficit to a 3–4 M-bag surplus, reinforcing downward pressure. 

Counter-arguments exist: the RSI is oversold (<30) and speculative net length is the smallest in 18 months, conditions that often precede sharp short-covering rallies. A daily close above the 380–385 ¢/lb resistance band—and ideally a weekly close back above the 200-day SMA (≈389 ¢/lb)—would be required to neutralise the down-trend. Absent such confirmation or a weather-driven supply shock, any bounces are likely to be corrective rather than trend-changing. 

Given the alignment of bearish trend metrics with a markedly more comfortable 2026 supply outlook, the 1- to 3-month bias remains to the downside. Key invalidation point: weekly close >389 ¢/lb.

[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",BEARISH,"[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-19] Coffee futures (Arabica) fell to 276.44 USd/Lbs (-3.07%), reaching the lowest levels since July 2025. [2026-02-19] Implied Volatility is ~48.09%, explicitly characterized as 'expensive relative to historical norms'. [2026-02-19] The KCU26 Put/Call Premium Ratio is 1.17. [2026-02-05] Brazil's Conab projects a record 2026 crop of 66.2 million bags (+17.2% YoY).
[ANALYSIS]: The critique of the previous analysis confirms the logic was sound but lacked emphasis on the efficiency of the trade structure relative to the skew. The market is unequivocally in a High Volatility/Bearish regime. Fundamentally, the Conab forecast (+17.2% YoY production) acts as a dominant supply-side depressant, validating the price break to 7-month lows. Technically, the Put/Call Premium Ratio of 1.17 indicates that downside protection is crowded and expensive. Therefore, simply buying puts would subject the trader to 'volatility crush' risk if IV contracts. The revised analysis reinforces the BEAR_CALL_SPREAD as the optimal execution: it capitalizes on the 'expensive' IV (~48%) by selling rich call premiums to finance the position, aligning with the bearish trend while mitigating the cost inefficiencies of buying downside protection in a high-skew environment.
