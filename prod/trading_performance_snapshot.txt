=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===

3) Bull’s “logistics embargo” is weaker on cross-check: Supply_chain cites severe Santos execution issues and the YoY export drop as proof of a squeeze, but Geopolitical frames Santos as moderate/variable friction (average waits ~2 days; localized delays) and highlights that some systemic shipping risks are corridor-dependent and not coffee-specific. In other words, the export decline could reflect bottlenecks, but the packet does not prove an acute, market-wide inability to move coffee that would overwhelm the much larger incoming crop signal. The Bear correctly attacks this as an overreach from execution friction to “embargo.”

4) Inventory tightness is real but time-horizon conflicted: ICE certified stocks are low and backwardation indicates spot tightness (Inventory report). However, that same report explicitly frames a tug-of-war with looming oversupply, which caps the durability of any squeeze. The Bear’s interpretation—that near-term tightness can exist while the dominant forward fundamental remains bearish—is more consistent with the full set of evidence than the Bull’s attempt to turn tight stocks into a durable bull trend.

5) Volatility cost awareness: The Volatility Analyst remains bearish and characterizes options as not fully pricing the decline’s speed (i.e., downside still plausible). This does not force a downgrade under the given rule (the “options expensive = bearish sentiment” condition is not met), and it supports the Bear’s trend-following stance.

6) Required trigger (Unusual X activity spike): The XSentimentSentinel spike (18 posts vs baseline 4.5) is itself bearish in theme composition—price decline/record Brazil crop dominate, with “bargain buying” a minority and overall confidence low. This is better read as confirmation of prevailing bearish narrative and momentum (and possibly late-cycle capitulation chatter), not as a robust contrarian buy signal. The Bear uses it appropriately as corroboration, while the Bull leans too heavily on “capitulation/smart money” inference that is not evidenced.

Evidence counting: Bearish signals come independently from Agronomist (weather/yield), Sentiment (narrative + additional supply/demand headwinds), Technical (downtrend below long MA), and Volatility (bearish regime). The Bull’s strongest independent pillar is Supply_chain (exports/port delays), but it is partially undermined by the Geopolitical moderation and by the overarching record-crop outlook. Net: more independent lines support Bear than Bull. [DA VETO: BULL TRAP FROM RECORD SHORT POSITIONING: The X-sentiment spike (18 posts vs 4.5 baseline) with 8/18 posts on 'price decline to lows' and only 3 on 'bargain buying' indicates a potentially crowded short. The 20% monthly drawdown to 7.25-month lows, combined with price near the 200-day moving average (~$2.75/lb per Technical), creates textbook conditions for a violent short squeeze. If just 10-15% of speculative shorts cover on any positive catalyst (weather scare, Santos closure, demand data beat), we face gap-up risk that invalidates the entire thesis within 48 hours.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.48, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 0.69, ""contribution"": -0.554}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.66, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 0.96, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 1.34, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.24, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 1.79, ""contribution"": 1.43}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""NEUTRAL"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.93, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 1.34, ""contribution"": 0.0}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.5, ""reliability_mult"": 0.4, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 0.6, ""contribution"": -0.477}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 0.66, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 1.0, ""final_weight"": 1.49, ""contribution"": -0.966}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0499999999999998, ""reliability_mult"": 0.52, ""staleness_weight"": 0.96, ""age_hours"": 1.4, ""final_weight"": 0.52, ""contribution"": -0.42}]",supply_chain,0.0,XSentimentSentinel,PROVEN,"Brazil supply outlook turning structurally heavier (record-crop forecasts reinforced by favorable bean-filling rainfall), keeping the dominant fundamental impulse bearish.",1.0,"The strongest bullish counter is the near-term physical tightness story: low ICE-certified stocks plus backwardation, combined with reported Santos execution problems and a large YoY export drop, could create destination-market scarcity and provoke a short-covering/mean-reversion rally.
