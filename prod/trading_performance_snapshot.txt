4. Demand side ignored.  Global roast-and-ground demand has been resilient; 2025/26 ICO consumption is projected +1.6 % y/y (ICO Jan-26 report).  While not explosive, it partially absorbs surplus.

Net assessment:  Record-size Brazilian output and rising exchange stocks (ICE certified inventory is up 0.38 M bags since December) tilt the balance bearish into Q3-26 when new-crop beans arrive.  However, weather/frost risk, producer-selling pace, and only moderate dollar-coffee correlation counsel caution.  Downside potential remains, but conviction is medium rather than high.

Price bias: Sideways-to-lower into mid-year (260-280 ¢/lb support zone), with frost risk creating Q3 volatility.

Fed officials Schmid and Logan signaled interest rates should remain restrictive, reducing March rate cut probability to near zero [Source: Morningstar / MarketScreener].

StoneX reports market weighing shrinking Central American availability against Brazilian carryover stocks [Source: StoneX].
[ANALYSIS]: The previous analysis correctly identified the bearish implications of the record Brazilian crop forecast and the Fed's hawkish stance but failed to adequately weigh the immediate supply tightness in Central America cited by StoneX. The revised view acknowledges that while the long-term structural trend is bearish due to the projected 23.3% surge in Brazilian supply, the short-term market is supported by shrinking Central American availability, explaining the bounce to $2.97/lb. The macro pressure from a stronger USD (driven by restrictive rates) reinforces the ceiling on prices, but the timeline for the bearish reversal depends on when the Brazilian harvest physically enters the market to offset regional deficits.
[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65
[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",NEUTRAL,0.0,"The bearish view is more grounded in the current data, given the Fed's hawkish stance which is known to strengthen the USD, thus applying pressure on USD-denominated commodities like coffee. The MacroContagionSentinel alert, with a severity of 9/10, underscores the potential for the Fed to tighten monetary policy further, reinforcing the bearish macro environment. Additionally, Brazil's forecasted 66.2 million bag harvest, as highlighted by multiple reports, suggests a significant increase in Arabica supply, potentially counteracting any current supply tightness caused by temporary logistical issues. While the bullish arguments consider immediate supply chain disruptions and production drops in Colombia, these factors are temporary and likely to be overshadowed by the impending Brazilian output. The market's overall sentiment, inventory build-up, and moderate volatility also suggest limited bullish momentum, supporting a cautionary bearish stance. [DA VETO: SCENARIO 1: Brazilian Frost Event - A severe frost hits Brazil's Arabica-growing regions (Minas Gerais, São Paulo) in the next 5 days, which though rare in February, could trigger panic buying and a 15-20% price spike. The 66.2 million bag forecast becomes irrelevant as traders price in potential crop damage, similar to the 2021 frost that sent prices soaring. Our bearish position would face catastrophic losses as the market reprices supply expectations.]",VOLATILITY,LOW,IRON_CONDOR,True,,,,,,"[{""agent"": ""agronomist"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 0.7, ""age_hours"": 4.0, ""final_weight"": 0.35, ""contribution"": 0.28}, {""agent"": ""macro"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 3.0, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 3.0, ""contribution"": -1.95}, {""agent"": ""geopolitical"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.0, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 0.2, ""age_hours"": 19.6, ""final_weight"": 0.4, ""contribution"": 0.26}, {""agent"": ""supply_chain"", ""direction"": ""BULLISH"", ""confidence"": 0.8, ""domain_weight"": 1.0, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 0.2, ""age_hours"": 19.6, ""final_weight"": 0.2, ""contribution"": 0.16}, {""agent"": ""inventory"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 0.5, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 0.2, ""age_hours"": 19.6, ""final_weight"": 0.1, ""contribution"": -0.065}, {""agent"": ""sentiment"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.0, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 2.0, ""contribution"": -1.3}, {""agent"": ""technical"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 2.25, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 2.25, ""contribution"": -1.463}, {""agent"": ""volatility"", ""direction"": ""BEARISH"", ""confidence"": 0.65, ""domain_weight"": 1.4, ""reliability_mult"": 1.0, ""staleness_weight"": 1.0, ""age_hours"": 0.0, ""final_weight"": 1.4, ""contribution"": -0.91}]",macro,0.0,MacroContagionSentinel,PLAUSIBLE,Fed's HAWKISH_PIVOT and Brazil's record coffee production forecast,1.0,"The bullish thesis points to current logistics bottlenecks and backwardation as indicators of supply tightness.
