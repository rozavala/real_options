=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
Positioning: Managed-money length has collapsed 64 % in two weeks, meaning much of the momentum-selling may already be in the market, increasing the probability of a short-covering rally if fresh bearish catalysts fail to appear.
Fundamentals: CONAB’s larger-than-expected Brazilian crop projection justifies a generally bearish supply backdrop, but it is early in the growing season; weather risks (frosts in June–August, excessive rains) remain latent upside threats. Demand growth (specialty and soluble) is tracking trend but not accelerating.
Bottom line: Primary trend = down; momentum = weak but not extreme; positioning = lightening; fundamentals = supply-heavy but weather sensitive. Risk-reward slightly favours patience on new shorts until either (a) 277 ¢ breaks or (b) rallies back to ~296 ¢ fail. Near term bias stays BEARISH, yet with reduced conviction compared with the original call.
Trade colour (not advice): Sellers could trail stops just above 293 ¢; would-be buyers might wait for either an intraday capitulation below 277 ¢ followed by quick recovery or an RSI sub-30 print accompanied by CFTC shorts rebuilding.

[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",BEARISH,"[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-17] Coffee futures (KCK26) trading at 286.03 cents/lb (-4% daily, ~-20% monthly). Implied Volatility (IV) is 35.93%, with an inverted term structure (Front-month ~36% > Back-month ~30.68%). Market assessment deems premiums 'cheap' relative to realized volatility.
[ANALYSIS]: The market is experiencing a severe bearish correction, confirmed by the 20% monthly decline and inverted volatility term structure, which signals immediate distress. While the previous analysis labeled this a 'LOW_VOL regime', this is technically a misnomer; absolute volatility is high (~36%), but premiums are 'cheap' relative to the extreme Realized Volatility (RV). The dislocation where IV < RV suggests option prices have not fully priced in the velocity of the crash. Therefore, buying premium (Long Put) remains the optimal approach to capture further downside while mitigating the high gamma risk associated with selling strategies in a crashing market.

I override it because multiple independent indicators (record-crop outlook under favorable agronomy, rising certified stocks, and higher global shipments) argue the system is not genuinely short of coffee—logistics look like timing friction, not a durable shortage—while the large negative 24h move indicates liquidation risk remains dominant."
