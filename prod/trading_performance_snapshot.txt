=== RECENT COUNCIL DECISIONS (Last 10) ===
Momentum: RSI-14 at 29.5 is deeply oversold, but—as seen during the autumn slide—coffee can stay sub-30 for weeks. A daily close above 282 ¢ (R2) would move RSI out of the oversold zone and confirm that buyers are regaining control; otherwise the reading is merely a warning that downside velocity may be slowing.
Vol term structure & inter-month context: The discount between front-month (KCH26 ≈ 293 ¢) and Mar ’27 (276 ¢) has widened to −17 ¢, suggesting the market continues to price in comfortable crop availability for the 2026/27 harvest. That weakens the bullish case made solely on momentum grounds.
Fundamentals: No fresh weather threats are reported in Brazil’s main arabica regions, and ICE certified stocks are slowly rebuilding (+18 k bags w/w). These developments align with the longer-term bearish bias.
Levels to watch:  • Upside: 279.5 ¢ (R1) then confluence at 282-284 ¢ (R2 + 50-day EMA). A break/close above 284 ¢ would target the 295-305 ¢ congestion zone.  • Downside: 272 ¢ (S1) followed by 267 ¢ (S2). A close below 267 ¢ re-opens the October low near 259 ¢.
Conclusion: Technicals hint at a possible corrective bounce, but the contract remains within a broader down-trend driven by ample supply expectations. Until 282-284 ¢ is reclaimed on a closing basis, rallies are likely to attract selling rather than mark a durable bottom.

[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",BEARISH,"[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-11] March 2026 (KCH26) Implied Volatility is ~32.95%, trading below the 100-Day Historical Volatility of 36.35%. [2026-02-11] Coffee prices have declined ~17% recently, with KCH26 trading at 293.55 cents/lb due to improved crop outlooks in Brazil. [2026-02-11] Option premiums are assessed as 'fair to slightly cheap' relative to realized price movement, with volatility skew showing elevated downside put premiums.
[ANALYSIS]: The market structure remains firmly BEARISH due to fundamental supply improvements in Brazil, causing a 17% price correction. While the aggregate Implied Volatility (32.95%) trading below Historical Volatility (36.35%) suggests options are generally undervalued, the previous recommendation of a naked Long Put failed to account for the 'elevated downside put premiums' noted in the skew data. Buying into elevated skew increases cost inefficiently. Consequently, the revised strategy shifts to a Bear Put Spread. This approach leverages the bearish trend and 'fair' overall volatility while selling the further OTM put to mitigate the specific richness found in downside strikes.
[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8
[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",BEARISH,0.9,"The evidence overwhelmingly supports a bearish outlook due to the expectation of a record harvest in Brazil, driven by ideal weather conditions such as above-average rainfall in key growing regions during critical stages. This suggests an incoming supply glut that will likely overwhelm temporary logistical constraints. Additionally, the Macro Report points out that the recent decline in exports is primarily due to farmer withholding, which will likely reverse with anticipated currency adjustments when the Central Bank cuts interest rates, signaling potential future market saturation. Furthermore, technical data confirm a downtrend with price action below the 200-day SMA and range-bound behavior, indicating that the recent small price uptick is likely a short-term fluctuation rather than a reversal. The bearish case is further bolstered by a strong evidence lineup including logistics normalization challenges and cautious speculative positioning, emphasizing an eventual market shift towards oversupply.
