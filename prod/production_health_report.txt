2026-02-12 12:42:05,634 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. The trade exhibits dangerous over-reliance on a single fundamental factor (Brazil's record crop forecast) that won't physically impact markets for months, while dismissing immediate supply disruptions confirmed by multiple sources. The 0.7 confidence level is unjustified given: (1) Three out of eight agents were BULLISH with high confidence (0.8) citing verified supply deficits; (2) The weighted consensus score of -0.514 reflects significant disagreement; (3) Critical N/A data on current price, IV rank, and IV percentile means we cannot properly assess entry timing or risk parameters; (4) The agronomist and supply_chain agents both identify CURRENT supply tightness that could persist for weeks before Brazilian supply relief arrives. The trade confuses medium-term fundamentals with short-term positioning risk. Wait for either: (a) confirmed improvement in Santos port throughput, (b) actual arrival of new-crop Brazilian supply in ICE-certified warehouses, or (c) a technical breakdown below the 260-280 support zone before initiating bearish exposure.

2026-02-12 13:40:46,052 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. The trade suffers from multiple critical weaknesses: (1) CONFIRMATION BIAS - We're over-weighting the Brazilian record harvest forecast while dismissing the Supply Chain analyst's 0.80 confidence bullish call on logistical bottlenecks and the Agronomist's 0.80 confidence bullish call on Colombian shortfalls. (2) TIMING MISMATCH - The bearish catalyst (Brazilian harvest) doesn't materialize until Q3-26, but the bullish catalysts (Santos delays, Colombian drought, Central American deficits) are active NOW. We're trading a September story in February. (3) CROWDED SHORT - Price already trading 11% below 200-day SMA suggests bearish positioning is consensus; any positive supply surprise creates violent short-squeeze conditions. (4) IGNORED DATA - We dismissed the backwardation signal (March 299.20 > May 293.10) which explicitly confirms immediate tightness. The weighted score of -0.273 with only 0.46 confidence is far too weak for a 0.70 confidence trade. Wait for either: (a) Brazilian harvest confirmation in June-July, or (b) confirmed easing of Santos port delays before establishing bearish positions.
