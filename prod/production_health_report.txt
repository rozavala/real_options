2026-02-24 16:05:34,050 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. This trade violates the core risk principle: we are selling into a sharply oversold market (-21% MTD, 15-month lows, record net short positioning) based on a harvest forecast 4 months away, while dismissing three critical warning signals: (1) a documented physical export bottleneck trapping 600k bags/month, (2) unresolved inventory data showing potential 25-year lows, and (3) persistent backwardation indicating immediate tightness. The confidence score of 0.7 is artificially inflated by weighting the agronomist's weather outlook (which measures current conditions, not harvest execution risk) and ignoring the supply_chain agent's 0.8-confidence BULLISH call on the Santos crisis. The 28-post social media spike and spec long unwinding we interpreted as bearish confirmation is actually a classic capitulation signal—when 'everyone knows' the story, the trade is exhausted. The asymmetric risk is brutal: limited downside to 260¢ support vs. squeeze potential to 320¢+ if Santos worsens or any Brazil weather threat emerges. At minimum, wait for either (a) ICE inventory data reconciliation, (b) Santos operational improvement evidence, or (c) technical confirmation below 260¢ with reduced short interest before entering.
2026-02-24 16:36:00,744 - trading_bot.agents - WARNING - Devil's Advocate VETOED emergency trade: DO NOT PROCEED. This trade exhibits classic 'bottom-picking into a narrative' pathology. We are selling at a 15-month low (278.05 cts/lb) based on a forward supply forecast that won't be validated for 60-90 days, while ignoring three critical present-tense warnings: (1) Physical tightness evidenced by backwardation (-10.95 cents Mar-Dec spread) and a 30% YoY export collapse that the supply_chain agent rates as an 0.8-confidence BULLISH catalyst; (2) The technical agent downgrades to NEUTRAL (0.65 confidence) citing 'price near 18-month support around 270 cts/lb' and 'risk-reward argues for cautiously bearish or neutral stance'—our own specialist is waving us off; (3) Macro uncertainty is profound (emergency cut + hawkish pivot + banking stress) yet we're treating it as a clean bearish overlay when the agent explicitly states it 'does not allow a defensible claim that FX or broad macro conditions were the primary driver.' The 0.7 confidence is inflated by agent-count consensus (5 bears vs 1 bull + 1 neutral) rather than evidence quality. The Bull's Santos bottleneck thesis has an 8-week runway before Brazil's main harvest (April-May); if that bottleneck persists, spot premia will explode regardless of Conab's projection. We are succumbing to recency bias (15-month low = 'must go lower'), confirmation bias (cherry-picking rainfall data), and false precision (treating a government crop forecast as realized supply). The asymmetry is wrong: limited downside to 270 support vs. potentially unlimited upside if logistics fail or weather deteriorates. WAIT for either (a) March delivery resolution + certified stock trend confirmation, or (b) April weather data + export normalization, before engaging. A 'grounded in current data' thesis that ignores present-tense physical tightness and relies on 90-day-forward assumptions is not grounded—it's speculative.
