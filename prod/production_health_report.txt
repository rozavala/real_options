2026-02-17 13:58:08,839 - Orchestrator - WARNING - COMPLIANCE BLOCKED Emergency Trade: Multiple unsupported or un-verifiable factual claims in the Decision reasoning given the provided evidence snippets. (1) It cites “price well below the 200-day SMA” and a “bearish bias below nearby resistance,” but the TECHNICAL evidence shown only includes last price (282.90) and support levels (280.08/277.2); no 200-DMA or resistance/bias is present in the excerpt → data gap/unsupported. (2) It asserts “front IV elevated and inverted vs deferred,” but the VOLATILITY evidence excerpt shown is about Brazil production forecast (+17.2% YoY to 66.2m bags) and Market Context shows IV metrics as N/A; no term-structure inversion is provided → data gap/unsupported. (3) It claims “Cecafé confirms a large year-over-year drop in January Brazil exports,” yet the only SUPPLY_CHAIN snippet visible says Brazil exported 2.78m bags in Jan 2026 (a 30…% figure is truncated) and does not explicitly state a YoY drop; could be true but cannot be verified from the excerpt → data gap. (4) It states “market is in backwardation,” but no backwardation/structure data appears in the provided INVENTORY excerpt → unsupported. (5) It references an “URGENT TRIGGER (Colombia Huila drought 13.1mm at vegetative stage)” which is not present in the AGRONOMIST evidence list; the agronomist instead indicates the drought alert is likely false given precipitation forecasts → hallucination/unsupported specific number. Critical-risk handling: the reasoning does acknowledge the key agronomist point (excess moisture / drought alert contradicted), so it does not ignore that risk. Direction vs sentiment: agronomist is bullish, but other agent reports are stale/truncated; not enough to say the overall sentiment is overwhelmingly one-sided. Main issue is the inclusion of several specific market-structure/technical/vol claims not supported by the evidence provided.
