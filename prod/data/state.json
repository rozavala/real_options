This agronomic reality corrects the premise regarding flowering (which concluded in late 2025) and directly supports Conab's forecast for a record 66.2 million bag harvest.

(source: ANBA / Market Estimates)']\n[ANALYSIS]: The strengthening of the Brazilian Real, as evidenced by a 3.38% appreciation over the past month, discourages farmer selling of dollar-denominated agricultural products like coffee. This is because a stronger Real translates to lower local currency revenues from exports, prompting farmers to withhold sales in anticipation of a potential weakening of the currency. The high Selic rate, currently at 15%, exacerbates this trend by maintaining elevated borrowing costs, discouraging liquidity-driven sales. Although there are expectations of rate cuts starting in March, this has not yet materialized, and the immediate effect remains bearish for export competitiveness. Therefore, coffee supply may be constrained in the international market as Brazilian producers delay sales waiting for more favorable exchange rates.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

(source: Maersk)\"]\n[ANALYSIS]: The evidence indicates significant bottlenecks in the logistics chain for coffee, particularly from Brazil's Port of Santos, where severe delays have prevented the shipment of a large quantity of coffee. This is likely to lead to a supply squeeze in the market, potentially driving up prices. Additionally, the ongoing crisis in the Red Sea, with vessels continuing to divert around Africa due to security threats, prolongs transit times and increases costs, further straining coffee supply chains from Vietnam. The EU Deforestation Regulation's delay provides some regulatory relief, but the year 2026 remains critical for compliance preparations, suggesting potential future regulatory pressures. Overall, these factors suggest a challenging logistics environment for coffee supply, predominantly from Brazil, with implications for higher prices.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

Despite a 7% decline in global freight rates (normally a signal of easing pressure), the physical flow of coffee remains obstructed by severe congestion, with 55% of vessels facing delays. This bottleneck has effectively trapped over 600,000 bags of coffee monthly and contributed to a ~20% year-over-year decline in export volumes. The introduction of blank sailings by carriers to manage capacity further restricts export slots, exacerbating the backlog. Under the operational rule 'Congestion above threshold = Supply constraint', this inability to move inventory despite lower shipping costs presents a bullish signal.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.9\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

This 'expensive' premium suggests fear is priced into the market, likely exacerbated by the immediate expiration of March options. However, the fundamental backdrop remains structurally bearish due to the robust Brazilian crop forecast (69.3m bags). While specific skew data for KCH7 is limited due to liquidity concentration in front months, the overall environment of elevated premiums combined with looming oversupply favors selling strategies.
