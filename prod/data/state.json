(Banco Central do Brasil \u2013 Focus survey)\n5) [2026-02-10] Safras & Mercado: soybean sales commitments ~33.9%, below historical average; cited reasons include BRL strength and low international prices. (Safras & Mercado via Agrolatam / UkrAgroConsult)\n[ANALYSIS]: Self-critique of prior reasoning (key weaknesses addressed here):\n- Potential over-inference / weak proxy: Using soybean commercialization as evidence for coffee behavior risks an availability/representativeness bias. Both are USD-priced exports, but producer hedging, financing, seasonality, and marketing structures differ; the soybean datapoint is supportive but not determinative for coffee.\n- Causality overstatement risk: The prior analysis leaned toward \u201cBRL strength restrains selling,\u201d but the provided evidence is correlational. In the soybean note, BRL strength is explicitly named as a factor, yet \u201clow international prices\u201d is also named; without quantifying each driver, attributing most of the slowdown to FX alone would be false precision.\n- Recency bias: Emphasizing a one-month BRL move and \u201cstrongest since May 2024\u201d could overweight short-term FX fluctuations relative to coffee-specific fundamentals not present in the packet.\n- Rates-to-FX linkage uncertainty: Noting expected Selic cuts and implying future BRL weakening is plausible, but the packet does not connect those expectations to a near-term USD/BRL path. So any claim that easing will soon boost selling would be speculative.\n\nRevised, tighter assessment strictly grounded in the packet:\n- Observed FX condition: The BRL has strengthened recently (USD/BRL ~5.17; strongest since May 2024; ~2% BRL appreciation over a month). If export prices are largely USD-denominated, this mechanically reduces BRL-denominated revenue per exported unit, which can reduce the incentive to sell/hedge immediately.\n- Cross-commodity corroboration (limited but relevant): In soybeans, a major Brazilian USD-priced export, Safras & Mercado explicitly reports unusually low committed sales and cites BRL strength (along with low global prices) as contributing factors. This provides direct evidence that, at least in one export crop, current FX levels are associated with slower producer commercialization.\n- Policy context: Selic at 15% is consistent with a supportive backdrop for BRL strength; the Focus survey expects easing by end-2026, but the timing/magnitude of any FX response is not established by the packet.\n- Implication for Arabica prices (directional, not magnitude): Given the framework that stronger BRL can restrain Brazilian export selling and the corroborating soybean example, the evidence modestly supports a view that near-term Brazilian selling pressure in USD markets could be reduced, which is marginally supportive for Arabica prices. However, because the packet contains no coffee-specific flow/commercialization/export data, this remains a directional inference rather than a high-conviction call.\n\nSentiment tag justification: The most defensible stance is NEUTRAL-to-slightly-BULLISH on Arabica from the FX channel alone. Because the evidence is indirect for coffee (soybean proxy) and does not quantify the effect, NEUTRAL is the more justified tag.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

(EY)\n[ANALYSIS]: CRITIQUE OF PRIOR ANALYSIS\n1) Logical fallacies / reasoning risks\n- Potential confirmation bias: I interpreted high ship counts + record throughput as \u201ccapacity pressure\u201d supportive of congestion risk, but did not test alternative explanations (e.g., high throughput can indicate the port is handling volume efficiently rather than being bottlenecked).\n- Weak causal leap (possible false causation): I implied soy-driven bulk export surges can \u201ccrowd out\u201d coffee/container capacity at Santos without providing evidence about shared infrastructure constraints (berths, labor, gates, container yard) or whether coffee flows are actually delayed.\n- Recency/availability bias: I leaned heavily on a small set of very recent datapoints (VesselFinder snapshot and one monthly throughput figure) and treated them as representative of ongoing conditions.\n- Overstated implication for prices: Saying the packet is \u201cmodestly supportive to prices\u201d was speculative because the evidence does not quantify coffee shipment delays, export differentials, certified stocks changes, or freight impacts.\n\n2) Specific sources vs vague claims\n- Strength: I did cite specific sources for each key claim (Splash247, Kuehne+Nagel, VesselFinder, DatamarNews, EY) and referenced the key numbers.\n- Weakness: Several interpretive statements were not directly supported by those sources (e.g., \u201ccrowd out container/berth availability for coffee,\u201d \u201celevated risk of scheduling volatility/rollovers\u201d). Those are plausible hypotheses but were presented too assertively given the evidence.\n\n3) Sentiment tag justification\n- NEUTRAL is broadly justified: the evidence set contains offsetting factors\u2014(a) Santos activity that could raise variability risk, versus (b) improved Red Sea security signal and (c) EUDR delay reducing near-term regulatory frictions. However, the evidence is insufficient to lean clearly bullish or bearish for Arabica prices; thus neutral is appropriate.\n\nREVISED / IMPROVED ANALYSIS\nThe evidence packet supports a view that near-term logistics risk is more concentrated in Brazil export operations than in EU regulatory gating or Red Sea security disruption.\n- Brazil/Port of Santos: Multiple indicators point to a high-activity environment: a VesselFinder snapshot shows 184 ships in port, 58 arrivals in 24 hours, and 227 expected in 30 days (VesselFinder, 2026-02-24), while Santos posted record January throughput of 12.7m tonnes (+9.5% y/y) driven by a large soy complex export surge (DatamarNews, 2026-02-19). However, the operational delay metric provided is not extreme: the 7-day average vessel waiting time is ~2 days, with terminal waits up to 38 hours (Kuehne+Nagel, 2026-02-12). Taken together, this supports \u201celevated load / potential scheduling volatility\u201d rather than confirmed severe congestion. Importantly, the packet does not provide coffee-specific delay data, container yard utilization, berth productivity, or exporter line-up information; therefore any claim that soy exports are materially delaying coffee shipments should be treated as unproven.\n- Red Sea/Suez: Splash247 notes no Houthi attacks recorded so far in 2026 and an EU mandate extension for Operation ASPIDES (2026-02-24). This is evidence of reduced immediate security incident risk versus prior periods, but it does not prove full normalization of routing, insurance costs, or schedules because the packet contains no transit-time or freight-rate benchmarks.\n- EUDR: The official postponement to late 2026/2027 (EY, 2026-01-20) reduces the probability of EU-bound coffee being held up by near-term compliance enforcement in 2026, making regulatory disruption less likely in the short run.\n\nImplication for Arabica availability/prices from this packet alone: the net signal is neutral. There is some incremental risk of shipment timing variability out of Santos due to high activity, but current waiting-time data does not indicate an acute bottleneck, and easing factors (EUDR delay; improved Red Sea incident picture) offset the logistics-risk narrative. Any price impact claim would require additional coffee-specific export/stock/flow data not present here.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: NEUTRAL]",

[2026-01-27] Cecaf\u00e9 Technical Director stated that 55% of vessels at the Port of Santos faced delays, preventing the shipment of approximately 602,000 bags per month due to 'infrastructure exhaustion' (Source: DatamarNews).

While global shipping rates are softening (Drewry WCI down 1%, Freight Index down ~14%), indicating easing macro-logistical pressure, the Port of Santos is failing to capitalize on this due to specific 'infrastructure exhaustion.' The 30.74% YoY drop in exports is directly exacerbated by the 55% vessel delay rate, which effectively traps ~600,000 bags monthly. This confirms a bullish short-term supply shock driven by physical bottlenecks rather than a lack of crop, creating immediate scarcity in destination markets despite the existence of the inventory at origin.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.8\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BULLISH]",

Global green bean exports rose 9.2% to 10.15 million bags in December 2025 (ICO).\n[ANALYSIS]: The market sentiment is BEARISH. The previous analysis correctly identified the trend but lacked confidence in resolving the conflict between the backwardated curve (indicating immediate tightness) and the bearish crop forecasts. The revised analysis places greater weight on the 17.2% increase in Brazil's projected harvest and the 9.2% rise in global exports, viewing them as leading indicators that will normalize the curve structure. The accumulation of ICE certified stocks to 459,204 bags provides the necessary physical confirmation that the supply chain is loosening, validating the bearish thesis despite the lingering backwardation.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

Sources are specific and cited appropriately, avoiding vague claims. The sentiment tag is justified, as the data points to bearish pressures from supply overhang and speculator capitulation, though oversold conditions introduce mild bullish reversal potential via short-covering.

Logical fallacies: The original note displayed confirmation bias by emphasising bearish technicals while ignoring potential bullish seasonality (e.g., Roaster restocking ahead of the northern-hemisphere summer) and possible weather risks to the flowering period. It also risked false causation by directly linking the Conab projection to the one-month price slide without acknowledging that crop estimates are widely anticipated and already partly priced in.\n2. Source specificity: All data points were time-stamped and attributed, but no demand-side or macro data were cited, limiting context.\n3. Sentiment tag: Bearish was defensible given the evidence, yet the analysis did not discuss scenarios that could invalidate the view, making the conclusion appear more certain than warranted.\n\nREVISED ANALYSIS\nPrice action: Coffee C is 29 % below its 200-day SMA and has posted a fresh 52-week low at 275.65 US\u00a2/lb. Momentum gauges (daily MACD and RSI <40) confirm persistent downside pressure, though the market is approaching oversold territory.\nTechnical outlook: A decisive daily close below 275 US\u00a2/lb would expose 250 US\u00a2/lb (psychological round-number / mid-2023 pivot) and then 232 US\u00a2/lb (61.8 % retracement of the 2020-2022 bull run). On the upside, bulls must first reclaim 295-300 US\u00a2/lb (broken trend-line) to relieve selling pressure; only a weekly settlement above 342 US\u00a2/lb would indicate a structural shift.\nFundamentals: Conab\u2019s record-high crop projection adds supply headwinds, but (i) the figure is preliminary and assumes normal weather through harvest, (ii) ICE certified stocks remain near multi-year lows, and (iii) global consumption growth of ~2 % y/y (ICO) could mitigate some surplus. Currency risk is two-sided: a weaker Brazilian real could accelerate producer selling, yet any real appreciation would tighten farmer margins and support prices.\nRisk factors that could upset the bear case include: unexpected frost during Brazil\u2019s June\u2013August winter, stronger-than-forecast El Ni\u00f1o-related dryness in Vietnam, or a pronounced rebound in discretionary spending that lifts out-of-home coffee demand.\nBottom line: The weight of evidence still favours a bearish bias in the near term, but proximity to major support and latent weather risks argue against complacency. Traders should monitor 275 US\u00a2/lb for breakdown validation and treat rallies toward 300 US\u00a2/lb as potential selling opportunities until the 342 US\u00a2/lb level is recaptured.\n[CONFIDENCE]: 0.65\n[SENTIMENT TAG]: [SENTIMENT: BEARISH]",

The Conab projection of a record crop (+17.2% y/y) indicates a genuine supply surplus regime, justifying the 15-month lows. While the market is technically oversold and IV is high (~39%), betting on a bounce (Bullish) fights the primary trend driven by tangible supply data. The revised analysis maintains a Bearish stance, interpreting the high IV as an opportunity to sell upside premium (e.g., Bear Call Spreads) rather than downside support.
