NEW INSIGHT from MACRO:
[EVIDENCE]: [2026-02-13] TheStreet Pro reports a 96% positive correlation between Coffee and Gold, calling it an 'odd relationship' likely driven by algorithmic inflation hedging. (source: TheStreet Pro), [2026-02-12] Arabica Coffee futures (ICE) trading around 292.50 - 314.50 USd/Lbs, near 6-month lows. (source: Trading Economics / Barchart), [2026-02-11] Conab forecasts Brazil's 2026 coffee production will reach a record 66.2 million bags (+17.2% YoY). (source: Nasdaq / Conab), [2026-02-12] Gold prices fell to $5,074.76 USD/t.oz, down 0.20% intraday, following strong US jobs data. (source: Trading Economics / Kitco), [2026-02-12] US Non-Farm Payrolls rose 130K in January 2026, reducing urgency for Fed rate cuts and pressuring Gold. (source: Trading Economics)
[ANALYSIS]: The analysis notes a 96% correlation between Coffee and Gold, suggesting that macroeconomic factors, potentially related to algorithmic inflation hedging, are influencing Coffee prices. However, the logic could contain elements of false causation or overemphasis on correlation without direct evidence. A strong US jobs report is linked to the correlation, but the actual influence of jobs data on Coffee is not directly substantiated, indicating potential weak causation. Additionally, the report on record Brazilian coffee production adds a supply-side reason for bearish sentiment on Coffee. Thus, while Coffee trading at near six-month lows supports a bearish outlook, the exact influence of macroeconomic factors and their interaction requires further exploration.

NEW INSIGHT from MACRO:
[EVIDENCE]: ['[2026-02-12] Arabica coffee prices traded around $2.97/lb, recovering slightly after hitting 6-month lows earlier in the week. (source: Trading Economics / Barchart)', '[2026-02-11] Fed officials Jeff Schmid and Lorie Logan signaled that interest rates (currently 3.50%-3.75%) should remain restrictive, citing strong demand and inflation risks. (source: FutuNN / MarketScreener)', "[2026-02-11] Brazil's crop agency Conab projected 2026 coffee production at a record 66.2 million bags, with Arabica up 23.2% to 44.1 million bags. (source: Nasdaq)", '[2026-02-11] Market participants reduced the probability of a Fed rate cut in June 2026 following unexpectedly strong January employment data. (source: Business Times)']
[ANALYSIS]: The analysis combines several economic factors that affect Arabica coffee prices, including interest rate policies and supply projections. The Federal Reserve's commitment to high interest rates can indeed strengthen the USD, potentially putting pressure on commodities priced in USD like coffee. However, this effect is not guaranteed to be bearish, as demand fluctuations and currency hedge strategies can mitigate these influences. The projected increase in Brazil's coffee production does suggest a potential oversupply, contributing to bearish pressures. The slight recovery in coffee prices should also be considered, as it may indicate market stabilization or other bullish factors. A more nuanced approach would take into account additional factors such as demand trends and geopolitical influences on global coffee trade.
